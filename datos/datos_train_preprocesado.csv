However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.

"propecia",8,"Moderately Effective","Mild Side Effects","male pattern baldness","Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!





My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 


partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.





To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.





Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.

"buprenorphine",10,"Highly Effective","No Side Effects","major depression","Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:


     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.


     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.


     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.


     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.","None.",1,5,10,1,5,"subutex most use help opiat addict withdraw comfort opiod drug vicodin oxycodon even heroin howev start subutex doctor luck find anoth med augment current depress medic effexor xr adderal partial work doctor found research suggest subutex partial opiat agonist although much differ properti compar think think opiat bind one opiat receptor brain respons mood doctor alway cut edg current research extrem openmind tri med welcom relief well almost good result medic definit aid treatment verytreatmentresist depress follow benefit notic take subutex 1 quickact subutex sublingu dissolv tongu get system immedi process digest system first 2 gentl effect definit experienc high just subtl notic improv feel wellb 3 also help somewhat anxieti calm effect normal dose happen without tired 4 notic side effect found psychiatr medic weight gainloss person chang sexual effect etc also case anyon worri subutex partialopi agonist must emphas med build toler make wantne increas dosag dose four year without ever even think need howev must understand case psychiatr medic simpli stop take medic without taper dose first will experi withdraw effect one save grace subutex though long halflif will remain system long enough prevent type withdraw even miss day two medic","none"

It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines.

Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription.","I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills.

She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time.

Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.

"wellbutrin",5,"Moderately Effective","No Side Effects","depression","I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.","None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.

"tazorac",9,"Considerably Effective","Mild Side Effects","acne, photoaging","This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.","Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.",2,4,8,1,4,"probabl best skin care productmedicin avail high effect acn photoag exfoli skin better anyth els thus unclog pore also speed cell turnov reduc keratin prevent comedoform smooth wrinkl make deep layer skin dermi thicker increas collagen product etc can read benefit pubm proven effect tretinoin retin acn photoag","initi quit irrit import start use less often smaller appli amount overdos tazorac els skin upper horni layer statum corneum will becom thin dri will crack thus will actual creat wrinkl rather elimin take slowli gradual increas dose wont problem skin adjust probabl start use everi 3rd 4th day initi gradual increas everi day even everi day peopl abl use twice day know cant case develop sever irrit must use good moistur prevent wrinkl format use acn use product benzoyl peroxid even care skin irrit cumul various drug will use lower dose bp 25 skin will exfoli easili irrit"

I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience.","Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.

live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some


prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered


headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide


open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil


and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management


physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days


without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked


forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have


probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When


I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without

live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some


prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered


headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide


open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil


and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management


physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days


without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked


forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have


probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When


I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without

I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny.

My hair also fell out in clumps!





All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished.

"warfarin",6,"Considerably Effective","Moderate Side Effects","heart condition","Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.


I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment.","The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.

Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in.

"zoloft",7,"Highly Effective","Moderate Side Effects","depression","Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 





Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them.","The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child.

"claritin",9,"Considerably Effective","Moderate Side Effects","indoor allergies","I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.





I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?

I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks.

"effexor-xr",8,"Considerably Effective","Mild Side Effects","anxiety, mild depression","Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).","Difficulty in reaching orgasm.

It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded.","The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.

"xanax",8,"Considerably Effective","Mild Side Effects","anxiety/depression","I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines.

Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.
