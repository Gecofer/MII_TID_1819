Although this type of birth control has more cons than pros, it did help with my cramps. It's also effective with the prevention of pregnancy. (Along with use of condoms as well)
I was used to having cramps so badly that they would leave me balled up in bed for at least 2 days.  The Ponstel doesn't take the pain away completely, but takes the edge off so much that normal activities were possible. Definitely a miracle medication!!
The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a "treatment for the symptoms". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life.
I think that the Lyrica was starting to help with the pain, but the side-effects were just too severe to continue.
after taking propecia for over a year, starting when i was 20 years of age my hair continued to thin, and i noticed no significant benefits
My mood has noticably improved, I have more energy, experience better sleep and digestion.
Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage.
This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.
none - did nothing to help allergies. i just had a dryer, more painful version of my allergies with new allergies/irritations developing on top of my original ones. this stuff is dangerous and the side effects that many people are experiencing are not listed on the package. a class action lawsuit needs to happen.
I experienced complete clearing of the Vaginosis after the regimin was completed.
Smoother more gradual onset and effect than Adderall. Effective at controlling ADD symptoms previously controlled by Adderall however this drug seems more natural and transparent. Less tension and anxiety. Less "druggy" unnatural feelings and thoughts.
I found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles.
For the first time in my life I had enough lashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions which only broke off or pulled out what few thin lashes I did have.  Strip lashes were itchy and uncomfortable.  I now have normal lashes.


Even though I only applied it to upper lashes the lower lashes have grown longer and thicker too.
Aldara did seem to crust up my previous skin cancer area and help minimize my scar from MOHS surgery for skin cancer. Due to the side effects I could only tolerate for one week opposed to 6 week regiman.
reduction in anxiety, no panic attacks.  drug is extremely effective
I'm taking Gabapentin to treat nerve disorder. My nerves are inflamed and causes to experience pelvic pain and other pelvic disorders. The Gabapentin sometimes works but I do experience relapse.





For the migraines


I find that the 800mg of Ibprofen works better with no side effect for my migraines, but the maxalt has a better track record.
don't know yet back to pediatrician today
Very good at relieving anxiety.  Good at generally calming me down and 'leveling me out' to make functioning easier.  Helps a little to relax muscle tension.  Calming effect makes an excellent sleep aid.
Controlled the psoriasis, however did not reduce its presence.
cure the ezcema and it took aout teh roughest of the skin
reduction of panic attacks and depression to almost nil
I took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal.
The treatment benefits included Skin Regeneration, and decreased Acne.  My skin felt more smooth and the pigmentation was disapearing.  Overall, the goals were accomplished however the redness of the skin took over.
fits settled down to maybe 1 a fortnight which were daily before this medication
Reduce number of MS relapses
I had taken Pulmicort, and other inhalants, with no major changes.  It became more difficult to maintain my exercise and lively life style. I gave in and began Symbicort and immediately experienced a relief of shortness of breath, weezing.  I feel like a new person. I still have a reaction to cold wind, and very high humidity, but so much better.  I rarely use my Albuterol.
I'm feeling more grounded; highs and lows are less extreme.  You could say that my emotional 'playing field' is more level.
It seemed to work at first, but then the side effects started. Fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). The hard part is I can't seem to get off this stuff!! The withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. It scares me so much that I just start taking it again. I'm stuck!! Don't ever start this stuff, there is something wrong with it. I don't know if I will ever be myself again.
decrease in acne pustules
Alert, awake, focused
My  bone density's results have always been stable and I was told to continue with the drug.
I was more alert during the first part of the day but I found that it wore off by the afternoon. I could focus clearly, and if I needed a boost during the day another dose was enough.
Sleeping 7-8 hours without hangover
I have taken antidepressants for many years, and this is first that did not "flip the switch" on sexuality.  I no longer feel like I am looking out of a dark room.  I have more energy, feel more motivated, and overall function at a higher level than before.
Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.
I have A-typical migraines which gives me weird sensation in my ears such as roaring and the sense that they are vibrating.  I also do have headacheds that seem to come from ears and the back of my neck.  It help me feel better and started to decrease my symptoms but side effects were worse than original symptoms.  It helped me to ignore my symptoms and helped me to get through the day.
migraine headache would stop
Assists with getting to sleep and due to longer half life than other anxiolytics(ie Alprazolam)anxiety is less upon waking. Whilst Alprazolam is extrememly effective for immediate reduction in arousal, I find Lorazepam more effective for overall lowering of anxiety.It has been especially helpful to start the day with little or no anxiety rather than with a high arousal level immediately needing management or medication.
I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.
relieves depression, helps other things such as sleep, dieting, exercise, relationships, responses to stimulous.  The cost is lower than other antidepressants which can be a help to those on a budget.
To stop with the migraines, seizures and pain from the fibromyalgia,also have neuropathy in hands and feet from diabetes
The stuff works like a charm--fast and effective.
The drug was pretty good for pain. They had me on morphine, which was horrible. The pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia I had. They then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects.
Effective at controlling seizures without dizziness
Able to tolerate the pain
very effective pain killer
Eventually Cleared my moderate acne. Had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate, but then accutane completely cleared my skin after 5 months
Brought down my overall cholestorol reading from 218 to 150, LDL from 135 to 90 and triglycerides from 180 to 140 within 3 months time.
The cream made the basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses react, scab up, and heal to nice smooth skin after about two weeks after treatment with the cream ended.
No undesired pregnancies, lighter period
I took Minocycline hoping that it would clear up my acne. I have been taking Tetracycline for over 2 years without no result, frustrated, my doctor prescribed Minocyline. After 1 year, I was still having break out just not as bad.
no menopose benifits are loss off sytoms of menopose. improved mood leval. I have felt more energectic aand as stated a general mood elevation. I have started working out , less irratable and overall calmer. The hormone replacement has improved my lifestyle and relationships to others. I am know longer quick tempered or irritable.
Lost over 30 pounds and still going!
acne cleared totally,skin became even.
After 2 days of taking the medication my stomach pain subsided.  The burning i also began to go away.  it took a full week for everything to return to normal for mw.
The pressure in my eyes decreased with use over a period of four months.
Skin in certain areas (e.g. forehead, cheeks) sun damage became less noticeable. Fine lines have slightly improved. However fine lines on the lower eyelids have become worse. It was therefore, not used on fine lines on the lower eyelids the entire 1 year. I have used it approximately 4 months out of the 1 year in this area. It made it crease up and look wrinkled
The med. controlled my seizure disorder.
Very well managed blood pressure within normal, healthy range.  I had an allergic reaction to a more common blood pressure medication, Lisinopril (which is a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).  The newer Tekturna has worked perfectly for me with only the slightest dizziness when I rose too quickly early on, but no side effects at all after the first few weeks.
smoother skin,less lines on the face and neck area,collagen in skin is firmer and supple
The drug reduced the frequency of acid reflux events and the associated pain
Lowered blood pressure.  This was the last prescribed medication for out of control high blood pressure.  Apparently, it takes all three of the medications


to work together. With all of them, my blood pressure is within normal guidelines (or very close), but without any one of them, there is an immediate rise
After 60 days on Crestor, 5 mg. per day, in combination with changes to my diet, my LDL (bad) cholesterol fell from 180 mg/dL (high risk) to 95 mg/dL (optimal), a drop of nearly half.  My triglyceride levels were reduced as well.
At the recommendation of the Life Extension foundation, I was taking 1850 mg per day of metformin prophilatically -- as an anti-aging medicine. Gene assay testing by Biomol resveals that metformin surpresses the Sir1 gene, acting as a calorie reduction memetic. Calorie Reduction is the only currently proven way to extend life span, and the hope is that metformin will mimic this. Resveratro ( herb ) also reputably does this.
It made me feel like my old self again, i was able to go to work and actually get things done and the medication took care of the edgy feeling i had and alot of my tendency to fly off the handle.  The medicine seemed to work great except for a few side effects.
Before I started on the drug Lexapro, I felt lethargic and didn't want to get out of bed each morning. I hated getting up and facing the day. I would sit and watch the time pass by. Finally, I went to my Dr. for a checkup and he diagnosed me as being depressed. He put me on Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg. I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times.
helped aleviate whip lash symptoms
weight loss, more energy
i have mild hypothyroidism, so i wasn't necessarily aware of what having an underfunctioning was doing to my body.  still, i was able to detect changes (for the better) after taking synthroid for a few months.  the primary benefit i aw was HIGHLY HIGHLY improved concentration, which has made school/work such a pleasure.  i think my metabloism also improved slightly.
it decreased my acne but never acne free,less oily skin,
face cleared up conciderably. It took about 2 months for the drug to become conciderably effective though.
I liked this drug very much, because the stronger doses of antibiotics gave me horrible yeast infections. However, this one didn't quite so much. It still kept my acne at bay, and worked.
Definitely lowered anxiety.
Reduce a lot the heartburn feeling, and after a week treatment no more heartburn where visible. Every other meal i was taken produced a lot of acid juices in my stomach, after that treatment this never happen.
The drug has slowed down the process of osteoporosis in my hips.  I feel much better, with less pain than before.  I was very pleased with my checkup when I went to my doctor.  I feel the combination of the Fosamx and the Caltrate Plus


will continue to improve my condition and make my bones stronger.
Feels like it stops nearly all acid production, heartburn is gone.  Due to cardia weakness stomach contents can still travel up esophagus but no burning sensation is felt.  Regardless there is still some mild irritation in my esophagus.
cold not discern because there was no clinical symptom other than tsh leel was low.the lab test result indicate improvement in tsh level but the doctor did not increase the dosage of the drug.
My pain and anxiety were considerably lower. I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle.
I did go to sleep more easily. I'm not sure how effective the time release is, because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at 3pm, would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours.
Angeliq did eliminate the night sweats and kept the hot flashes to a mininum. I have had severe vaginal dryness (even tearing) and a host of infections (yeast & bacterial). I remain a bit irritated and I have NO sex drive.
I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person.
Migraine problem: I now only have rare occurance of migraines, less than once a year.  Before Prepro treatment I had a migraines almost continuously, and took Frova at least twice a week. Potential benefits is prevention or delay of osteoporosis, since my mother had severe osteoporsis.
I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced.
For the first time in my life, I had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions previously but they only worsened the problem by breaking off or pulling out what skimpy lashes I did have.  After several months of Latisse I have eyelashes and even though I apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too.
The Wellbutrin with 20 mg of Prozac daily as an adjunct alleviated most symptoms of depression.  Better sleep as a result, and more energy throughout the day.
Along with the tamiflu, pretty much cleared up any problems I had except for my cough. It was not as bad as a cough, but was still present. It took about 2 days for the medication to actually work but it does a good job.
nearly instant pain relief , extremely efficace
Hair loss. Helps hair follicles become less sensitive to protestosterone.
My cholesterol was lowered by about 15 points. I did not seem to do anything else nor was it supposed to.
The treatment cured the sore throat for which it was perscribed.
the treatment benefits for the cream Tazorac were improved skin tone, appearance of reduced wrinkles on forehead, undereye area, upper lip and nose. The skin felt softer and pimples were not prominent.
Increased bone density by 11% first year.
Very good euphoria. More focused in school. Had a very very good feeling in torso area. I forget to eat sometimes and afterwards stomache hurts very  very bad. You do not realize that your hungry.
It's been only one week and I am seriously amazed at the results. some small spots are invisible and i can see the larger ones fading, my skin already looks more even and balanced and less irritated...after only one week!!! I also love the matte finish it leaves, so you are looking greasy and oily all day. It's hard to believe but I am getting really excited for the results
I took this medication, Valtrex, upon first experiencing the sensation of tingling and itching symptoms associated with the onset of the beginning of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak on my face which I had experienced many times before - usually once a year.


The next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 


By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.


On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.


By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 


This medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak.
Do not experience hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings or insomnia due to menopause when using the Femring.
Well I just wanted to comment or get some incite on this medication. I was just proscribed this medication yesterday took first one before bed as doctor said and woke up this morning feeling like i had drank a case of beer i stumbled getting up out of bed then i felt like i was dying of thirst was just wondering how normal this was? Oh and i was very sleepy and unable to wake up till nearly noon i started to sober up. I have a 3yr old son that i stay home with so i need to be able to function. when i had spoke to my doctor about the problems i was having i told him that i did not want to be on anything strong i had previously been put on Vicodin, oxy-codone and flexeral i hated it i could not take care of my son i could not function im just trying to find a solution for my pain without being messed up.! See back in October of 2009 i fell backwards into a dresser corner while putting my sons clothes up in welkin closet had two possible fractures and two slipped disks was in a neck brace from oct-feb so please let me know if you have any idea what i can do my insurance will not cover physical therapy unfortunately .....
Minimized pain immediatley and made back injury seem non-existant
My overall cholesterol reduced to just over 4, but not LDL which still remained high within that total. This in my opinion is due to my thyroid condition.
Little if any relief from headache.
I found for me it was great for pain relief. Also, unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs I had taken in the past, I was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and I felt as if I could function normally.
Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.
Easy to apply, combination of retinol and antibiotic.  Treated acne and an anti-aging treatment too.  The gel is odorless and goes on easily.  It is also non-greasy which is important if you have combination or oily skin.
The benefits are that it does take away night sweats and hot flashes.
After trying Celexa for several months this drug finally made a difference with my anxiety and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I noticed considerable change after using for 3-4 weeks. I am much more tolerant of things being "out of control" and have stopped some of my "patterns".
I was not able to ascertain any benefits from being treated with this medication.  Its purpose was pain relief, and I did not experience any alleviation of my pain.
I have slightly high blood pressure on the diastolic side. Lotrel did a good job at maintaining good levels without increasing my pulse which I experienced with other BP meds.
Viagra did help me in acheiving an erection after prostrate surgery. Other methods that were offered were not as attractive at the 3 times daily dosage of Viagra.
While taking this method of birth control, my period only came once every three months. It was much lighter than before and only lasted 3 days instead of 6, which was normal before. I didn't experience any bloating. It's a very cost-effective method compared to three-month supply of normal 28 day cycle pills.
decreased appetite, help to stop abusing alcohol
I didn't take the product long enough to evaluate the benefits. I quit because of side effects.
significant, but not complete, relief from symptoms (sneezing, itchy eyes, cough, hives) while exposed to allergens - cats, certain plants. works best as preventative, but also works fine for relief from symptoms.
The benefits from the ambien CR were phenominal when trying to fall asleep. It worked very well.
Finally clear skin and less oil!  Prior to accutane I HAD to wash my hair daily it was so oily  but now I easily an go a day or two.   My face and back were perfectly clear.
Able to breath at night, less sneezing. I woke up with less nasal stufiness and felt clear headed. I also appreciated the moisturizing glycerin in Nasonex. I have a extremely dry nasal mucosa so there was definitely a benefit to that.
got rid of the uti, however, it took longer than d-mannose a non-prescription otc natural sugar which also had no side-effects
There were no benefits, only bad side effects in that the drug significantly worsened my ability to breath.
While taking Xyrem, I slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds.
When I started first taking it it was great. I would get up in the am no brain fog, and could work the whole day not being tired. By night time though I was exhausted. After a month or so I still get up early but by afternoon I am so tired I usually try to take a nap or just keep going and eventually it will get better. I have not tried taking another in the afternoon. I have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference.
The medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine. Now the panic attacks are few and far between. Although I do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if I must I can with no problems. In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode.
Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had "bouts" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life.
There was a significant reduction in mouth pain. I was able to relax following periodontal surgey and not worry about family obligations and responsibilities.
Moderate lifting of depressive episode, made it so I could function better in everyday life.
The patient saw effective acne control within 4 weeks.  She still had occasional acne lesions but saw clearing of most of the comedones.  Because there were few new acne lesions, the hyperpigmentation she got along with the acne was not happening, and the hydroquinone helped to clear the hyperpigmentation she already had.  At four weeks, her skin tone was even.
I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug.
Over time, this drug caused a massive reduction in my OCD hand washing rituals. I also no longer had to avoid public places for fear of germs.  Furthermore, clomipramine caused an immediate decrease in day to day anxiety and worry.
THE NUVARING HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ME. I HAVE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH BIRTH CONTROL THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. HAVING TRIED MANY IF NOT ALL POSSIBLE  BIRTH CONTROL TREATMENTS, I BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKS THE BEST FOR ME. IT IS PRACTICAL AND VERY FEW SIDE EFFECTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, IUDs OR  INJECTIONS.
The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all.
I would say that in general, I feel more happy since im taking Effexor. I am more patient and less agressive. I was really irritable with a constatly ''under pressure'' feeling before. Now i feel a bit less concentrate maybe but way more relax.
Had generalized anxiety daily prior to treatment, and panic attacks that impaired ability to function normally and quality of life in general. Medication did not completely eliminate feelings of anxiety, but did a great job of reducing them. Taking the medication Serzone, made it possible to rely on the medication xanax less and less, to the point only had to take it seldom as needed.
enables me to get on with my life and be mobile. without it my back and neck become "stiff" so I also combine taking the drug with daily exercise to keep myself as fit as is possible. my condition was inherited from my father.
As near as we can tell, this drug (which is intended for men with enlarged prostates) relaxed ureter muscles, relieving the sensation of kidney stone pain, and also relaxed bladder muscles that had caused painful urination.
reduction of pain, pain reduction was necessary in order to be able to withstand the pain of aggressive physical therapy, i reduced the frequency of use after the first 3 days to avoid secondary complications such as intestinal damage, constipation, etc.
preventing further hair loss
Effectively controlled acid reflux.  Before treatment patient had severe acid reflux which was not controlled by other medications.  After trying many other drugs the patient was prescribed protonix and it worked very effectively.  The patient was then able to eat regular meals with no ill effects.
First treatment in 50 years that helped the constant but elusive pain in my nervous system, causing me to sleep an hour or two at a time at best.  The pain is 100% gone when I take the mirapex ... back when I do not.
marginal, not sure if recovrey was from the drug or from the infection running it's course.
Wrinles seemed less defined
None. She did an anaphylaxis schock and she did not receive any benefit .
apparently lowered cholesterol and blood pressure
The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.
I started out with 100 mg twice a day and after about 3 years I've had to increase dosage to 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg at bedtime. It seems to keep my arthritis fairly under control but I have never been able to just take it once a day but I've also had arthritus for 35+ years. Unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. This mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what I want to do.
My skin cleared up and my pores shrank significantly. My skin looked flawless. My pores have remained smaller long-term (5+ years post treatment).
relaxed
I suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. Prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that I did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids.
Without question, Actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, "lollipop" form and within minutes you are comfortable.


The flavor is also quite pleasant.
Treatment cleared up the infection.
I have been taking meridia for the last 6 weeks and have lost 16 lbs.  It has decreased my appetite and I am not thinking about food all the time.  Combined with diet and exercise this has helped me out a lot.
No impact whatsoever.  It was like I wasn't even taking anything.  The OTC ibuprofen I was taking before my doctor appointment was more effective.
As a medical professional (newly graduated medical student now in first year of residency), I am able to feel more alert and focused during the day even after having been up all night.  As free time is scarce in residency, I am now able to study when I would otherwise be too exhausted to do anything.
-Prevented pregnancy perfectly


-Enlarged breasts


-Regulated periods


-Lighter flow during menstrual cycle


-Cleared skin for (moderate) acne
i no longer had seizures. i was having a seizure everytime i ate food. my sizure responce was food.
After trying a variety of high blood pressure medicines my doctor prescribed Zestoretic.  Zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of 100/70 from 130/90.  The difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  After experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic I began watching my sodium intake.  I avoid any food that contains 900 or over mgs of sodium per serving.  This pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  After 16 months of watching my sodium intake I have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt
Malaria prevention.  Also patient did not intcounter any mosquito bites.
I became more active and lost 10 of the 14 pounds I had gained.  I have more energy, and feel like myself again.
Completely controlled nausea and vomiting.
I was only sleeping around 5 hrs per night. I felt sleepy ALL the time. I had episodes when my whole body would ache, every joint and muscle. It felt like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing it until my eyes would pop out
marked reduction in hyperpigmented (age) spots, marked reduction in wrinkles around mouth and eyes, skin surface became much smoother and softer.  Truly turned back time.  Visible results within weeks and first 2 months were remarkable, but over the last year, the benefits have continued and areas of brown discoloration I thought would need laser therapy are almost cleared up!  I also had some scar dents that have cleared up and/or mostly gone!
The treatment benefits from Topamax did not outweigh the side effects.  There was minimal reduction in vocal tics caused by Tourette Syndrome and significant reduction in appetite that led to weight loss of approx. 20 lbs.
NONE
Cleared acne
I used to live on my MDI(combivent). I started maintenance drugs Spiriva and Symbicort and it has changed my world. I, on adverage, dont have to take my MDI at all anymore. I have my days that I have to, living in Texas can be a nightmare of allergies. I can do more activities without feeling so short of breath. I have not had any major side effects yet...Overall after starting Spiriva I'm doing much better. For anyone with Asthma I would suggest they try this drug.
According to her & what I was able to observe  there was not much benefits to this treatment  .
Little improvement for first week or so but then incredible turnaround. Went from regularly not being able to walk properly due to inflamed sacroiliac joints and general back pain and flu-like aches across whole body most days to a new woman! After 3 months have noticed the last couple of weeks some of the aches and pains starting to come back slightly towards end of the week but overall extremely positive.
oh there was benefits, I did not have allergys and my my heart rate was down.
The drug caused the iris to contract so that the drains that relieve fluid buildup causing high pressure are pulled open.  While using the drug the pressure in my eyes remained stable but high.  It had the added benefit of sharpening my vision for a long time so that I did not need to wear glasses for reading phonebooks,etc.
Almost immediate relief of allergy symptoms, freer breathing
Since using the Retin-A along with the Accutane, I have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.
The medication ease the nausea and my stomach was at ease for at more than a week.  The medication relaxed the muscles in my stomach and released the gas trapped.
The treatment reulted in significantly lower blood pressure - in total a drop of over 30 points on both the upper and lower readings.
mood stability and two safe preganancies wtih healthy children.
helped lower blood sugar
Other Osteoporosis prevention drugs have many side effects.  This particular drug has almost no side effects and has shown evidence in clinical testing to reduce the occurance of breast cancer.  The only side effects I had are leg cramps and apparently, only a very few women experience this condition.
A more positive outlook and much easier social interaction.  Introversion diminished and friendly extroversion became more natural.  It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.
rapid heart beat stoped, and blood pressure went down.
I saw great symptom reduction in my facial eczema which included itchiness and redness. Previously I was treating my eczema with topical corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and fluticasone. I had been using topical steroids for years and had developed cystic acne. After a few courses of antibiotics for acne treatment I realized using antibiotics was pointless if I continue to use topical steroids. I decided to try an anti-histamine which surprisingly helped greatly. Enough so i could discontinue my hydrocortisone. Using loratadine helped my eczema be tolerable but not "cured". I also managed my eczema with a lot of moisturizing.
I had recently developed hotflashes which were becoming notceably worse.  Very shortly after beginning this drug, my hot flashes stopped.  I am hoping there are other benefits like preserving the integrity of my body, but it may be too soon to tell.  It definitely alleviated the hot flashes, however.
treatment of low thyroid state and low metabolic state
Hormonal cysts cleared up and did not recur after 3 years. My lips were rather dry and I had to moisturise them frquently. But the treatment was 100% effective and entirely worthwhile.
helped with muscle spasms in my hips. Helped reduce pain from the spasms - particularly good when driving or sitting for a long time.
My Dr. prescribed Cymbalta to treat my chronic tension headaches. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year, but gained about 30 pounds. Due to the excessive weight gain I gradually went off the Lexapro. Well- about 5 weeks later my headaches came back. My Dr. reccomended Cymbalta b/c it "weight neutral" and also has pain relieving properties.
The treatment benefits were only temporary.  While it made sneezing and watery eyes diminish, it did not address the issue of respiratory difficulties.  I found that it may have even increased my respiratory symptoms in this process.
Wasn't as severly depressed as before taking the drug, didn't sleep as much and was able to function normally in a job.
initally taken to stop smoking and the cravings did go but i still continued to smoke a few a day.
Stabilized my moods, stopped my racing thoughts, and stomped all over my paranoia
after the tritation period, where the drug dosage was increased each week, the headaches became less severe and less frequent. from having 2-3 migraines a week to eventually having none and was able to discontinue the medication.
This drug did, in fact, erradicate the adult acne I'd been plagued with since turning 29.  I didn't have awful acne, but it was persistent.
Effects on the infection were immediate; felt better in the 


first week of treatment.
While on abilify I can honestly say the depression resolved,
Relieved symptoms of itchy runny nose providing relief from discomfort
Seem to have a bad sinus / nasal infection, now up into ethmoids.  Seemed to start with attempt to drain tear duct, but blocked.  Helping but not kicking it.  They've now changed me to my choice of Omnicef or Levaquin, I chose the Omnicef.  We'll see if it does the trick.
None
The occurance of medium to large acne on cheeks was almost non existant. There still was the occasional small white head and they generally healed quickly and left little to no scarring.
Total seizure control; however occasional auras continue
fast onset of action.  quicker than a zpak with is erythromycin. for 5 days.  Onset of action is faster and patient starts to feel better in two days versus a week.
It helped by tight neck muscles relax so when I woke up, they didn't hurt.
Helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and I didn't have any attacks.
I felt less sadness.
Worked to well
More energy and endurance, much more able to concentrate, skin elasticity improved and noticed overall skin rejuvenation and tightening, sleep improved and wake up feeling more rested, aware of vision improvements and improved libido.
Ability to relax enough to sleep. Gradual relief from severe TMJ and tension that began to feel like being frozen solid. Relief from restless leg syndrome. Ability to relax gradually over time. Relief from chattering teeth.
hair growth, regained at least 50% of lost hair. seriously I did and continue to use it
Decreased hot flashes, minimal mood swing and axiety.
After about two weeks of being on the medicine, I started to feel a little better but I think it takes awhile for it to really kick in. The medicine has helped me by the following:


Lessened depression, better overall mood, slightly less irritable and sensitive, better able to function daily
Lexapro worked very well to make me feel better, less anxious and unhappy.
The skin tone got better, more uniformness, got rid of part of melasma and freckles. Reducing oiliness and minimizing pore size. Getting rid of acnee spots very fast.
Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.
I was prescribed Keflex to take as a precaution to prevent infection prior to a scheduled surgery.  I took if for several days before and after the surgery.
Within the first few days, could tell a dramatic difference in my sinus infection clearing up.  After the full two week dosage, 98% better!
pain relief, frequencey, urgency relief
I have tried many other medications that were useless.  Over the counter as well as other px.  This treatment always works.  The headache subsides in one to two hours.
overall more at ease mantally was the only true benefit I felt.
Took all the terrible pain burning throbbing swelling paper cuts and constant


Urination and pressure felt like id been hit inside was sore all the time even with out sex it was there constant pain around my Vaginal opening like a burn or sratch and inside too my genitals inner labia and clitoral hood have shrunk 


Ive been postmeno for 15 years Sex became almost normal except for entering


Id say it worked 95% some days and 100% others
Alleviation of mild depression, effective progressively after 3 weeks of start. Removal of anxiety.
None
When I first began taking the pill my periods were regulated and I did not cramp nearly as much.
Treatment benefits are stabilized thyroid.  Was having a weight issue, and with a blood test it was determined that the thyroid gland was "sluggish".  I was very exhausted also and it has helped somewhat with fatigue.
That I felt able to function.


The dose was perfect for my condition.


Felt more calm and moods much better.
smoother cheeks, skin, No other benefits.
It reduced the amount of acid that my stomach produced and therefore allowed my stomach and esophagus to heal to some degree. I also took it for years to control my regular acid reflux problems.
Had to take an extra 1/2 pill in addition to prescribed dose of 1/2 pill per event, usually night before in order to achieve satisfactory benefit of performance.  Previously used another brand but was discontinued by HMO.  Much depends on regular exercise & regular sleep activities to be effective.
BENRFITS OF TREATMENT: Unsure - My legs ache. I don't remember ever having any real pain, other than an annoying ache in both legs. I feel as though I am walking in wet fishing boots.  There is a buzzing in my legs and feet. It has over the past several years crept up from my ankles to above my knees. With all this I do very well walking a slow pace - sometimes like a drunken Sailor. I walk down 101 stairs  tale a short walk and come back up 2 at a time (slowly) holding onto a rail (now).
None!
restful sleep
I would get painful swelling in my feet.  I could not even stand the bed sheet to touch my feet.  One time while on vacation I was swollen up to my knees.  The medication makes my life easier.  I don't have to worry that when I wake up I won't be able to walk around my house.  I rarely have any slight indication that the gout is going to be a problem.
I felt that i did not feel any benefits from this drug.
Sometimes lessoned redness
elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.
The Zyprexa minimized agitative outbursts
This drug definitely helped control flares and joint stiffness. It also helped defeat the incredible amount of hives. Hives were completely controlled.
Loss of the desire to smoke and eventually the cessation of smoking altogether.
daily hot flashes and night sweats are much less severe if any at all. sleep is less distrubed and mood swings are much less. i no longer feel enraged when i wake in the morning.  Depression is gone and i feel less tired (probably because i get more sleep).
none
Greatly benefitted depression. I started to take this just before my child was born, having had post partum depression with another baby, and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic, if not more hectic, when this child was born as when the older child was born. I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born.
quite effective without the adverse effects of aspirin, naproxin etc.


because of the reported side effects of cox2  meds i take as little as possible to maintain a reletively comfortable exixtence
After having tried several over the counter treatments for this condition, this treatment was the only one that effectively treated the condition.  The itching and discoloration began to dissipate after a few days and symptoms were completely gone after two weeks.
I've only been on it for a week but I've noticed a change already. I am more awake and it seems as though a fog has been lifted. I am thinking more clearly and don't feel so down.
reduces pain
It definitely reduced the size and severity of the cold sore but now I get the more frequently.  Like twice a month!!
It greatly helped with my depression which was caused by a divorce after 28 years of marriage. 3 months after my separation my Father died and my Mother became very angry and unresponsive with me.When I started taking this medication I was able to focus better at work and at home I was able to effectively deal with my emotions, I also experienced an increase in my libido. I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion).
I saw almost no benefits to this treatment with re: acne, though possibly there was exfoliation or collagen benefit. I believe it exacerbated my acne. On the mornings after the nights I used the cream, my acne seemed to come out much worse (particularly on the chin & jaw area where the condition was the worst).
at the highest dosage, the generic, gabapentin, seemingly reduced nerve pain resulting from Peripheral Neuropathy following surgery to remove neuromas in both feet (although it is a very subjective pain, which is affected by other factors: tension, sitting for prolonged periods, etc.)
i could control my panic and knew i could. therefore, just having lorazepam with me was often enough. over the years, my attacks diminished, first in severity, then in quantity.
The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication.
My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.
increased energy. better focus. better sex drive. more "alive" than when only taking lexapro and loestrin.
The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month.
It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience.
I've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! I have no side effects, just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  But my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time I've been on it! Would definently recommend to anybody.
None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.
slight lightening of dark spots. there was really no benefit beyond this.  seems like a waste of time and in fact, just regularly applying sunscreen seems to do a better job of lightening the spots
Was often so tired that I barely got through my work day and would go home and sleep.  My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.
My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies.
Helps with concentration and staying focused. Helps to keep me from being hyperactive and fidgety and helps with memory to an extent.
The treatment benefits of taking Provera were very good. I had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  By taking the Provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again.
Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.
I couldn't tolerate the side effects, so I was unable to experience the benefits.
resolved depression within one week. I was told it did not work that fast, but I know it did. It is
Seroquel provides a good night sleep, which is very important for mood stabilization. It also helps to calm, and smooth over the rough spots of daily living, while not robbing you of your personality, ie, you still feel like yourself, just calmer.
aldara was used on several areas on my face where i had scar revision surgery to help heal surgical wound on face.  It was prescribed by my doctor to speed up healing.
The treatment benefits was a minimal weight loss, but not nearly as much as I expected.
Helped with sleep. Could reduce valium, trazadone without withdrawal symptoms
Overall reduction in the severity of breakouts.
Medication helped with depression, my irritable bowel syndrome, appetite control, and there were no sexual side effects
cholesterol and trigl. went down
Dries quickly on skin, can be worn under makeup, prevnted bactreial breakouts from makeup sensitivity
Eliminated nicotine cravings and made smoking cessation very easy.
I did not get pregnant while on the depo shot... but then again my sex life was shot due to the constant bleeding.
I am able to get good restful sleep and that is so important in my pain management.
It seemed to help make me not want to smoke. I seemed to not even think about smoking at times i would normally smoke. I think it would be very efective if the side effects werent so great.
Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.





during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.





it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.





Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.





With that i have only this to say:


Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries.
Cured the tonsilitis/strep throat
Is very helpful with insomnia.  Was able to put racing thoughts that run threw my mind at rest.  Was able to get into a deep sleep.
The drug did seem to make me feel more confident at the beginning, however towards the 10 11 months it didn't seem to work anymore.
After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.
So far so good. Will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. One area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. No inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before.
I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.
Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:





1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.





2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.





Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 





Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.
I could not see any benefits. I certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.
This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.
good for skin
Reduced AM fasting glucose
Apparently, this ace inhibitor has positive effects against retinal and renal pathologies associated with diabetes and other cardio-vascular diseases.
ABSOLUTLEY NONE FOR ME.
feeling more relaxed and able to go to work, the breath slowed, shaking stopped and mood improved
I needed to switch from straterra which made me very very depressed quiet and i slept for like an hour each night with that drug it was horrible. I switched to Vyvanse and the first time i took it, it was like an anti deppresant at first i was the normal happy hyper me but i could still focus very well on studying but when i started comming down from it that was the worst i was dry heaving with a TERRIBLE HEADACHE for an hour and then i would just throw everything up it made me very irritated i would twitch ALOT and my heart beat was fast and very heavy but after my second day my body started getting use to it and i havent had anymore problems with it.
It allowed me to feel good enough to ignore and not be bothered by persistent thoughts and anxiety that I could not ignore before. Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore.
At first, could actually sleep. The sleep issue has been life long and various natural things helped but not always.  As stress increased, nothing helped,not even the Ativan.
My symptoms of depression were eased considerably.  I felt more like myself and began to take pleasure in activities. I stopped feeling sad and crying. I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.
I had severe hot flashes all day and night. The night episodes kept me awake most of the night with alternating hot, sweaty flashes, followed by teeth-rattling chills.  Prempro eliminated the vast majority of episodes so i could sleep
The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more.
Decreased redness and bumpiness by day 6. I believe the benefits were associated with the prescribed medication. However, I was also using a histamine blocking topical cream during the course of treatment.
the prevacid allows me to eat and drink certain foods/fluids that I normally could not tolerate anymore without great discomfort i.e. spicy foods, coffee, chocolate, tomato products, and alcholic drinks, which I only drink occassionally such as red wine.  If I skip the prevacid for any reason, I almost certainly will be very uncomfortable.
I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 


The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.


Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.


On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.


I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.


The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours.
My daughter suffered from an outbreak of painful skin boils on her lower back and stomach, probably 6 total over a few weeks.  They would heal individually after draining (also painful) but more would continually form.  The doctor diagnosed them as caused by MRSA and prescribed Septra along with daily washes with hibiclens soap.  It took 5 days for one very large, undrained boil to heal, but it did heal without draining.  More importantly, the boils stopped forming.
'Was diagnosed with H1N1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course.
I did not experience any benefits whatsoever.
A non return of breast cancer
Reduction of pain and inflammation.
good unless a stop for a few days
The quality of sleep is better that ohter drugs i've taken is the only benefit I  find.  I tried to taper off of it and fould it very difficult the lowest doesage i can take is 100mg.  a little drowsy in the morning but after a couple of cups of coffee im fine.
There was very little benefit to me. I was having psychotic episodes every day. The drug puportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. The best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.
pregnancy prevention
Significantly decreased depression and suicidality, improved sleep, more stable moods and increased energy.
The benefits were highly good in the fact that it immensley eased the pain in the joints of my mother.When she stopped taking the medication she was faced with accute pain again, so she kept on taking it.
Noticeable improvement within 24 hours. Marked improvement within three days. Cleared sinus infection and bronchitis in the ten day prescription time period.
My allergies were a little better.  My nose was not as runny.
My acne improved when accompanied by monthly exfoliation peels.
Minimized pigmentation. Some of my acne scar has faded but some still remain.
The drug prevented emotional highs and lows.  Specifically helped with crying too much.  Lessened the intense "caring".  In some cases, it lessened it too much.
lessening of nerve pain, decrease in depression. Medication will be increased as nessesary. Decrease in parathesis, shaking. Exercise is needed to truly relieve pain. Water based therapy can definetely add to releif from pain. Depression medication helps, relieving the other symptoms, and can increase sleep. In general all treatments, Lyrica, anti-depressants, muscle relaxers and exercise program (including stretching, weight-resistance, aerobic and endurance training and water excerises - this should be followed religiously) combined contribute to relieving pain, depression, control weight gain, and give patient back some resemblance of a normal live.
This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness.
this drug will make a migriane sufferer inot a real believer in modern medicine--it really gets rid of the headache and allows you to live. I could not be more positive
Without the Voltarin, every step I take makes my joints feel like cracking glass and they ache constantly. This drug greatly reduces that pain throughout the entire day.
The product took great care of my razor bumps.  If I applied it at night, I was clear by the morning.  I only stopped taking it as the condition itself lessened.
After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.





Valtrex is an amazing drug!





My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 


partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.





To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.





Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.


 


Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours.
If I took the Zovirax at the first sign of tingling it would prevent an outbreak.  If I waited I would still get blisters but they would only last 2-3 days.
resolved UTI.  Symptoms improved rapidly and with 3-4 days, the urge to frequently urinate had completely subsided.
It has totally neutralized the effects of my reflux.
After I built up a tolerance, I had little peeling when I applied it only once a day. Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the Retin-A is a good addition.
Relpax would take the migraine headache away, including secondary symptoms such as neck aches, jaw pain, and nausea.
I got pregnant.
In comparison with other antidepression medications I have taken prior to the effexor, It actually began working faster than the others (after about 2 weeks).  Most antidepressants usually take closer to 4 weeks to see improvements. Depression symptoms were significantly reduced.
Had surgery on my neck, the lortab reduce the pain.The lortab help relieve th pain upto eight hours so I did not need to take as many pills to find release. This is a good thing because I do not like pills.  This medication helped tremedously.
My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem), but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting, and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches.
While standing, my legs were fine, but aching, cramping legs were keeping me from getting any sleep.  My doctor suggested I try Requip, and its been the best thing I have done.
I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea
relieved pain at first but quickly became tolerant and wouls wear off hours before the next dose was due
The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.
Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.  There was a short period where I ran out of restasis and stopped, after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared, only to do away when I resumed treatment.
Adjusted thyroid levels.
4 periods a month 3-5 lbs weight gain
benefits were the pain relieving benefits
No apparent benefits.  Had virtually no effect on my depression and it quickly became intolerable to use.
Differin took several months to take effect and initially seemed to make breakouts worse. After using for some time, however, breakouts ceased and skin became nearly acne-free,
the xanax has a calming effect, and takes the edge off the effexor side effects.
cured the UTI
Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking "opiate"), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:


     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.


     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any "highs". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.


     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.


     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a "partial-opiate agonist", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.
It assisted the ibuprofen and cortizone in pain relief.
I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.
My hair loss was stopped and I eventually grew new hair at the hairline and where the hair had receded on the side. I do not know if it affected my crown.
I took it before bed, and it helped me get to sleep. It also helped me cope during a difficult time emotionally.
Elminated 95% of Migraines/Headaches!
nothing noticeable really, night sweats improved (slightly), memory, not as fuzzy
Benefits were the prevention of pregnancy, regular periods, shorter periods, and less intense pms symptoms.  My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period.
The drug Levothyroxine 100 mics daily that I took for hypothyroidism was advantagious for my metobolic effect. I did have more energy and felt more alert and awake, as before where I felt lithargic and brain dead.If I inadvertantly skipped a day of medication, I felt like I would notice my sluggishness a few days later.
This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime "hangover" effect and the dose can be increased easily.
lowering of intraocular  pressure /keeping it under control
The symptoms and mal feelings of my prostate disapeared - but not completely (perhaps 70% of the Problems disapeared).


Sexual Funktion and feelings of prostate improved remarkable.





(Only 70% of improvement perhaps my personal problems were not solved with Ibuprofen - and such problem put a lot of stress on prostata in some men)
Some symptoms of depression - crying all the time, dark thoughts - were lessened, although hard to know how much benefit the treatment gave all told or whether I would have come through it anyway as I had in the past.
The drug seemed to effectively treat the symptoms of depression for a year or so.  After the first year or so the depression seemed to come back now and then - although it did seem to be cyclical.
skin looked healthier with fewer break outs and was smoother. I noticed pores becoming smaller
I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.
In addition to quickly resolving Bronchitis, asthma improved significantly. Better breathing than I've had in months (prior to bronchitis). Had horrible coughing spasms that caused me to vomit phlegm and almost strangle (several times). Cough and throat irritation diappeared within 2 hours of first dose of Biaxin.
when the standard treatment for hypothyroid didn't work to raise my baseline t3 & t4 levels, i continued to experience all of the low thyroid symptomsA:  coldness, lethargic, depression, etc.  by taking cytomel on the 5 x daily basis, i have very close to normal functioning thyroid activity.
Accutane cleared up my skin immediately. During the first month, there was no noticeable change, but after about 5 weeks, my acne slowly disappeared and has not come back.
The benefits helped "curb" the pain.
I would get heart palpitations and major stress hours before my ex would come and pick up our daughter for visits; I also had difficulty sleeping if I had to deal with any issues with him; I would take one of these pills, only if I felt I needed and sometimes an hour before he would pick her up, and I would feel much calmer.  It was a life saver for  me until I got through the emotional upset and was able to detach.
My mother had slight high blood pressure and was prescribed Lisinopril along with the water pill. The medication was doing its job, lowering BP to normal.
the overall experience was positive, with little to no side effects, blood pressure medicine dropping blood pressure from 180/100 to 117/70 in 3 months.  lower blood pressure prevents heart disease and risk of stroke or other ailments associated with hypertension.
There was a decrease in dryness and discomfort.  I thought there also was a benefit to my mood and outlook.  Additionally my skin was more supple and had better color.  There was no pain associated as before.
no a.m. headaches
Taking the medicine was only once a day at the time I chose to take it. It helped me most during stressed situations of any size. I could handle anything and not get angry.
Significant reduction in the amount of pain that patient had on a daily basis.  Pain was not only lessened by time it was felt was lessened as well
After applying the medicament, the itching sensation reduced after 20 minutes and irritation slowly dissapeared after 10 days, The irritation  occasionally re-occurred. I have applied the medicament occasionally (about twice a month) when the irritation re-occured for about oone years. Now the irritation never reappears
decrease in moodiness, irritability, cessation of depression/dysthymia related symptoms.
moderate eyelashn growth  but no change in eyelash color
Made me sleepy enough to shut down and go to bed, although it typically still took  me hours to get to sleep. The sleep that I got from this medication was deep and refreshing.
I have a recurring sinus problem wherein my nasal passages get blocked and throat and vocals are affected.


This is aggravated by my smoking as well.
After about five days the yeast infection symptoms (itchiness, pain) disappeared.
after one year of taking this drug pregnancy was acheived via IVF and successfully carried to term with help of blood thinner heparin
It cleared up my coughing within 2 days.  I could sleep far better at night.
The benefits of the treatment were clearing a fungal infection that plaqued me for a few months.
The Lumigan made my lashes grown longer and thicker. I didn't need to use as much mascara.
Once a day, sometimes 2 in a 24 hour period depending on the severe headache
I took the drug shortly after having my tooth pulled.  I never noticed a great amount of pain, and contribute this to the laughing gas and novicane during the proceduce, and taking the vicadin shortly after the procedure. I took the vicadin drug twice because after several hours I started to feel pain again.  It was effective in reliefing my pain.
I noticed hair regrowth in small amounts but did not know my genitals were shrinking.  A friend told me of his testicles shrinking on the drug and so I examined myself and realized that what once was, was no more.
lightning of dark pigments
General Medical:  The treatment is for contraception.  I used it for weight control, skin problems and as a contraception, it was very effective for all of it except that when i left the medication I experienced severe hair loss which i was not warned about
none...I am reguired to write fifty words bon the treatment benefits but since I had to discontinue the drug or die there were no benefits and I would be telling a bald faced lie if I said there were and but I will keep on typing so that I comply with the request for the fifty word minimun
when the drug actually kicked in, after about 10 days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.I got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. I was whistling!!!I stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. I realized I felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time. Never forget it, a fantastic feeling.Truly helped me to cope with the stress of business and relationships.I have recommended it two occasions both had a similar experience to my own.
it controls my anger pretty good.
reduction of anxiety, better sleep quality, reduced gi symptoms (stress related)
It works very well for anxiety. As for depression, it works but when I get into an episode of MAJOR depression, it seems to be somewhat ineffective at those times.
Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did.
treated the insomnia effectively.
Provigil allows for better wakefulness in the daytime which in turn assists in better sleep. It also indirectly boosts mood by allowing some level of function during a chronic illness where things can easily spiral downward.
elimination of pain in elbow .reduction in general muscle discomfort to rest of body after gym workout.
BP running normal - no seizure activity - cholesterol good
less red spots, helped remove red spots...which were usually worse after hot shower, but I enjoy that so I use the metrogel after that when symptoms are worse and it seems to help. I enjoy  coffee, wine, hot spices, hot showers, really only limit sun exposure and the rosecea seems better. Also in the morning if I notice red spots it seems to help.
After about an hour, headaches disappear. This drug works better for me than other drugs taken before the year 2000, such as Imitrex and Zomig which I took for migraines. Imitrex sped up my heart which scared me. Zomig took 2 hours to work for me.


Maxalt changed my life as I finally am able to function instead of wasting a whole day in a dark room in tears from the pain of migraine. I do not miss work days anymore.
I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear.
Restored me from total incapacitation to a full function.
I believe that there are multiple treatment benefits of Taking Tylenol for my headache. Tylenol is safe, inexpensive, and does not require a physicians prescription. Additionally, it is available almost everywhere and therefor is convenient.
Reduced panic attacks, in combination with Lexpro. Particularly effective when taken an hour before panic inducing situations, such as flying.
Reduced redness of complexion; reduction in overall inflammation of skin; reduced breakouts of acne.
For many years, every Spring I would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. After a few days, these symptoms went away. It really surprised me because I had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. Some years my symptoms were so bad that I couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because I was sneezing so much. Taking this medicine gave me my life back!
The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression.
Pills helped to lower my blood pressure.  Also helped to relieve water retention.  Eliminated headaches associated with high blood pressure.  Although possibly unrelated experienced some weight loss.
It is extremely, powerful antibiotic, which give immediate effect with in two hours.
Density of hair was maintained and some hair regrowth that was noticeable by others. It was used in conjunction with Minoxidil, which I had been using for a year or so.
Lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks.
the hives were controlled
There were no benefits as the sniffling, dripping, coughing continued even on the medicine.
For years I was sleep deprived due to working conditions.  Rarely would I enjoy the luxury of a full night sleep. Typically I would take hours to get to sleep and had extreme difficulty remaining asleep. Dreams were too realistic and often I would be more tired in the morning than upon retiring to bed. Taking Lunesta has allowed me not only to get to sleep but return to sleep.  If I wake in the middle of the night, for example to go to the bathroom, I am awake and not stumbling. The vivid dreams are gone and I have experienced no groggy or hungover symptoms that you sometimes hear of when taking sleep medication. 


It has truly changed my life and I am so grateful for my Dr. for his prescription.
This medication enabled me to think clearly.  My thought processes were more coherent.  It assisted me in concentrating and therefore I was able to complete tasks --- finally had follow-thru! I was able to manage my time better.
prevented 90% of tachycardia incidents. when tachycardia did occur it was less dramatic
My ovulation cycle was regulated, however I did not get pregnant.  I am continuing to take it this month.
It lowered my cholesteral considerably.  My total cholesteral was over 300 and my LDLs were over 200, but after being on Lipitor for three months, my total cholesteral is now 186 and my LDL is 86, so I am in good shape.  In addition, I have experienced NO side effects whatsoever, so I am pleased.  The only drawback is that it does not come in generic form, so my co-pay is $40.00 per month.
When i was having a severe reaction normal antihistamines would not stop it so i needed to use panfacort which stopped problem within 30 minutes and the residual effects lasted on a a day or two.
None
My sinus infection felt better, although being unclogged, I constantly am spitting up mucus (especially after eating or drinking anything but water).
I have rhinitis almost all year long. Usually it gets worse in the cold season. I have tried many other medicines, but they either have too much side effect, or don�t work for me at all. This nasal spray clears the congestion in 10 minutes, doesn't last for the whole night, but the pretty pleasant smell make me feel good.
Definitely made me fall asleep. Very fast acting, about 10 minutes after taking it, I feel groggy.
All but stopped my hair loss.  After a couple of months I noticed that i had virtually no hair in my hands after washing it as opposed to 25-30 hairs before... also no more hair on my pillow, whereas before is was quite obvious it was falling out. Visually there is no more loss.  I don't know if it is growing back, but as long as it stays i'm cool...
cost savings and more control versus combo of Levoxyl and Cytomel.  Without insurance, I got my doctor to write a year's worth Rx and ordered in from Canada.
Hardly any except I felt so physically tired that I couldn't even feel depressed.
This works EVERY time I get a cold sore. Stops the cold sore in it's tracks, immediately!!! Took one at first sign of tingling. Now that I have a prescription, I rarely get them anymore.
medication allowed the patient to relax and helped reduced pain in legs. This resulted in reduction of Restless Legs Syndrome and also allowed the patient to have a good nights sleep. Minimal soreness in legs next morning.
When you are in a mild depression or dystimia the worst thing is that you are unable to think or concentrate, you feel sleep and tired all the day. It's like 


having a permament cloud in your mind. I think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now I have a sharper mind, I feel more energetic and I can concentrate properly.
I can eat and drink more normally without as much acid reflux and vomitting.  My condition results in slow digestion and intollerance of some foods.  With prevacid, I eat small amounts and avoid irritants.  I have had refluz episodes in my sleep.  With religious use of prevacid, this rarely occurs.  I can eat a larger variety of foods. It has made a positive difference in my quality of life.
got rid of migraine pretty quickly, in about half an hour, but was not as good as imitrex, the brand name. Imitrex would get rid of the migraine more quickly and more completely.   There would be times, perhaps one out of three, where I would  consider taking two of the 50 mg sumatriptans
Pain is now under control to some degree.  Still have pain throughout body and down legs.  Before the medication I would not be able to get out of bed for sometimes days.  Even when I could get out of bed I would not be able to sit up or walk for more than 30 minutes before I had to lay down.  Now I am able to be up all day, walk and sit up for more than 3-4 hours at a time.
Pentasa seems to be an effective anti-inflammatory drug, minimizing pain in my intestines/colon.  I have been close to remission for a couple of years now, and I attribute it primarily to the Pentasa.
I am now wide awake--for the first time in YEARS!!!  My body aches have lessened greatly.  I am alert.  I can keep up with the housework.  I have a better memory, concentration, and overall mood.  I have regained my creativity.  My appetite/desire to overeat has decreased, though I still have an appetite.  I just eat like a normal person, now.  I don't suffer from emotional or boredom eating.  I am steadily losing weight--8 lbs. so far.  I also have the energy and desire to exercise, something that I couldn't do before.  I feel like someone handed me my life back!
Got rid of my raging epidimytis and prostatitis. The pain started to subside within 2-3 days. Within the first week almost all symptoms were gone. Minor symptoms persisted until the 11-12 day. By the 14th day all symptoms were gone. BUT - the side effects were awful.
Immediately took the pain from the Strep away.
I sufffered from dibilatating panic attacks, but they only lasted 15-20 minutes max. I was taking klonopin every once and awhile which helped a little, but by the time the klonopin kicked in the attack was over. It got to where I had an attack at least every other day. The Citalopram kicked in in about 2 weeks and I've had only 1 episode since, granted I've only been on it for 2 months but it has worked wonders for me.
Less depressed, I could consintrate on daily life better. I was happier, less anxious, stopped worrying so much.
none, I felt worse. This is probably a drug that works for some people but didn't work at all for me in fact I felt much much worse. Unfortunately, I didn't review the contraindications.
To lessen the severity of an onset or outbreak of genital herpes.
Less depression.  Had more energy to do things.  Able to get involved in activities that I would otherwise not engage in.
I feel that the citalopram helps keep me calm. I no longer have mood swings as often. No longer feel the need to just stay at home bymyself. No longer want to leave work because of depressed moods.
Highly motivated vs my previous state of, "why do I get up in the morning"? Nothing upset me- even something that would put down a generally happy person.
WOW. I find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist.
stopped sneezing runny nose and other allergic symptoms.effecive for common cold and fever if given in the begning of the disease.can be taken till the sputum changes the color to yellow.can be taken till transparent sputum or discharge from nose.result is very quick (within some hours after taking the tablet)
It was a cream base that was easy to apply, twice a day.  It seemed to help with an allergic skin rash due to detergent irritation.  It was not as strong as a higher dosage cortisone cream, but it was still effective.  There were no side effects of note.  The cost was higher than over the counter preparations.  All in all, it was a good choice for stubborn skin irritation issues.
Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.
I feel alot less pain taking the Flexeril (only at night) and the Lyrica.
Seroquel is the first medication that really seemed to work for me. I have taken it along with several different combinations of meds, but the Seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past 5 years. I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing, so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time. The effects I attribute to the Seroquel include lessening of depression, anxiety and aggression.
Reduced acid production to normal levels.
my urination problems (urgency , frequency , etc ) practically disappeared and I no longer had get off my bed to urinate several times during the night
Initially I was prescribed it to knock me the hell out after 4 days of beautifully manic insomnia. Then after the mixed episode ended they spiked the dose over the course of a few months to 300, where it sits. 





The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 


As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect.
After a month taking, the cyst is shrinking considerably. It was a few cm big. By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then.
I'm only four days in, but I already feel more like myself than I have in a year and a half.  The effects were almost immediate.  I've taken more responsibility, had more energy, and been more outgoing already.
The medicine has stopped her wetting both day and night and worked within a week of her taking it. She is over the moon and so am I!
Honestly I have felt no change in my symptoms. If anything it feels as if they are getting worse. I constantly am getting sever headaches and my symptoms have not alleviated. I have not experienced any type of symptoms. I am also extremly tense to where the tendons in my neck do no sit flat.
When I began taking Tramadol I had severe Arthritis pain and could not sleep more than 3 hours a night. Tramadol relieves the pain without making you feel drugged up. I had to take up to 6 tylenol or 4 ibuprofens and it still did not touch the pain.
Absolutely no benefits, did not seem to get better even in a week.  Through research I learned that penicillin does not treat a virus and that a virus must run its course.  No idea why my doctor precribed Penicillin.  Would rather he had been on the up and up about it instead of precribing a worthless treatment.
The trimethobenzamide significantly reduced nausea and brought it down to a perceptible but comfortable level.
a feeling of caring but not really caring. I feel like i become emotionally involved to deeply and this drug has kept me on the "surface" for lack of a better term.
If drug is taken at very first sign/symptom of cold sore, the drug will elliminate it within that day. If the cold sore has fully surfaced it will still help to speed healing (usually within a week). This medication is not a cure for cold sores.
Had to take a thyroid replacement, so it did that, but not as well as I would have expected.
No improvement at all in symptoms.
Daily application, cured the fungal infection despite side effects.  Over the counter use of lotrimin AG did no work, and prescription alternaitve medication using miconizole nitrate (same as in monistay) cost upwards of $200 / tube, as my insurance did not cover much of it.
This medication completely erased symptoms of the hives.  The first time that I took the medication the hives were already 2 days old, therefore, it took about 2 days for them to clear up. Now, if I ever feel the itch or see the blotchiness I can take one dose of this medicine and the hives do not progress and they are clear within one day.
Reduced symptoms of acid reflux
I believe that I suffered from depression my whole life.  I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life.
Solodyn virtually eliminated any acne I had, both on my face and body.  It took about a month to see dramatic results, but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication.
I initially switched over from Axert since my insurance covers more of the Imitrex prescription.  Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing, sensations of tingling/prickling, weakness, drowsiness, dizziness, and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold "booklet" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert!
I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.
Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes, itchy ears, itchy throat, sneezing, nasal drip, congestion and borderline asthma; however, during high allergy season, the regular dosage was insufficient, the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours, instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above.
Motivates, keeps me focused and helps me stay calm and alert in the same time.  Not as noticeable as stimulants but more steady, no ups and downs, and it works round the clock reducing the rebound from when Concerta wears off after approx 10 hours. Stabilizing effect on the mood too.
It cleared up my nasal allergies, my stuffy nose, post nasal drip and as an added benefit it also helped prevent getting hoarse.
Fistula is considerable reduced. Almost healed. Fluid developing in the fistula is also healed. Frequency of stool passing is also reduced to twice a day.
None
A total of 20 pounds lost in one month.
Skin became smoother, fewer breakouts
Although this is not available in generic, I am using the generic versions of alphagan and betagan in conjunction with this drug. Each drug was used independently to determine side effects before they were combined for treatment. (This was a many visit process! But the results have made it was worth it) This combination lowered my intraoccular pressure to the point that it was not necessary to have surgery - my next step since other combinations did not work.
Not as tired, thicker hair, not gaining weight as easily
Able to sleep throughout the night without waking up, not groggy in the morning.
I had two arthroscopic surgeries to my right knee with little relief or benefit from the surgery. I was prescribed Ambien 10mg at bedtime as needed to help me sleep. On the nights I didn't take the medicine, I woke up all through the night. With the medicine, I slept well and soundly.
My total serum cholesterol dropped from 280 to 198, LDL dropped from 225 to 122, HDL increased from 38 to 57. My triglycerides were already low due to a strict low-carb diet. My blood pressure was already low (104/70) due to verapamil therapy to prevent cluster headaches, and has remained low. I experienced no serum increases in liver enzymes, urea, or sugar.
The drug helped to decrease hyperhidrosis
drug helped alleviate stuffy feeling without much notice of any side effects.
I experienced a weight loss of approximately 3 kg in 1 month. The effects tapered off in the second month with the total weight loss to be estimated at 6 kg. Subsequently I felt less urge to snack
There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it.
Patient experienced no treatment benefits.
Increased hair growth in the thinning areas on the head, making the hair look fuller. I also experienced less hair falling out.
I was not able to use the cream long enough because of the side effects.
increased synaptic dopamine levels. This gave me an amazing sense of wellbeing and clarity.
the benifits of the treatment were that it stopped the pain. i could sleep at night. i could eat food that i could not eat before. because i was not in consent pain i could get on with my life
This cream was very beneficial for the treatment of acne and some blemishes.  I had many pimples around my mouth after getting waxied there and nothing was helping.  Further as soon as one pimple went away another formed.  This cream began to work within several days.  I could tell that the pimples were getting lighter and new pimples that were forming would hardly enlarge because I applied the cream as soon as I saw a new one forming, many of them disappeared without even leaving a blemish affterwards.
I assume this birth control prevented pregnancy effectively. My boyfriend and I used it as a back up.
Small pill easy to take.  Easy to pack in a travel pack in an alternate pill case without taking the entire bottle.
Within a couple of weeks, intrusive thoughts of suicide abated.  Over the next few weeks mood lifted some.  At the time I started I was desperate & hopeless was quite surprised it helped as much as it did without usual side ffects of anti depressants-sexual sidew effects & weight gain.  Didn't cure depression but definitely helped severe suicidality.  And I'm against anti-depressants as 1st run for treating mood disorders but there is a place for them when exercise, sprirtual practice, good nutrition & life balance not enough-but these life practices absolutely indispensible for any health issue esp. Mood disorders.
Wellbutrin and Prozac stabilized my moods and kept me from slipping into depression. There really wasn't anything more to it, but I gather I have to write 50 words, so here they are.
Remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. I had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for 12 years and tried to treat it with OTC drugs. It appeared one night, not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years. If I miss one dose I know it. Falling asleep is no problem. My problem is staying asleep for more than 2 or 3 hours night after night after night. . . Not fun.
A considerable decline in the occurrence of new spots accompanied treatment. The acne has been practically eliminated if a good cleansing routine is maintained. Red marks have faded. Blackheads have cleared up. The overall result is clearer and smoother skin.
Eventual Acne reduction.
regulated bladder control to allow patient (me) to return to a regular life and not have to modify all movements by where the nearest bathroon is located.
my acne cleared up within a few months, and now it is gone.
After about a week, I started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 





Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding.
for vaginal bacteria with foul smell, I dont know if the treatment is effective it is only 2 days but then I started yo have to side effects
decreased inflammation of cervical spinal column, increased motion of cervical spinal column, decreased pain in other joints, decrease in neck pain, etc.
the benefits foe the pain was good, it helped the constant pain i was having in my muscles and the over all aching
It really help me to cope with the anxiety
With the valtrex I was treat coldsores only and could aviod break outs yr long. If i stopped I was garenteed to get one
Definitely noticed right away that I had more energy, better concentration and motivation, and could actually focus for the first time in years. By taking this med, it caused a chain reaction that got my life moving forward again: I started by becoming able to get out of bed and get things done around the house. Had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition, better exercise, self care, etc. Then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more. Now the med simply acts as a support for me, but I am ready to start tapering down my dose!!!
none, only took one pill and found that the side effects do not warrant continued use.
Benefits were intended to be no facial acne
I experienced a some evening of skin tone, somewhat smaller pores and very slight improvement in crowes feet
Improved ability to focus and concentrate. Memory retention better. Improved energy. Mainly helped relieve brain fog that is common with Chronic Fatigue/Fibromyalgia. Especially noticeable while working. Able to function better and work longer, more like my old self.
It was fairly successful for the acne.  I found it especially good at spot treatment if I felt a cystic type coming up.
singulair dramatically reduced coughing spells and allergy symptoms, but if just one treatment was missed the allergy symptoms reaccured.
The benefits were that once I started taking it, I became less emotional when I got upset.  I could handle the small things better than before, which used to set me off.  It evened out my moods so that I was less tempermental.
There really weren't any - I didn't feel any better as the stressors in my life were still there.  I did not feel any relief from the depression, as a matter of fact, I felt worse.
Did improve my appetite, which was suffering as a result of the depression.
I had deepening frown lines on my forehead and between my eyes....the benefits were a decrease of the lines (wrinkles).
Long lasting erection
Cleared up the infection but any number of other drugs would have done just as well, without the awful side effects.
relief of depression, "floor" under worst moods, increased confidence, less sadness. Allowed patient to function normally in work and social situations
very effectively reduced my blood pressure to a good level and has amitianed it for the 2+ years I have been taking it.
Within days, the acne disappeared. When taken continuously for 3-5 months at a time, the acne never reappeared and the hirsutism decreased substantially.  We then added laser hair removal and stopped the spironolactone.
the treatment benefits were reducing acne, helping me to have a more clear complexion.  Also it GREATLY reduced my cramps.  And, to this day, I am not pregnant :)  The benefits of this "pill" were far greater than any others I have tried, and I have tried several different brands.
Decreased blood pressure, decreased cardiac load, decreased kidney load
I experienced Xannax more effective for anxiety and panic attacks.
Retin-a provided the benefits of reducing sun damage of the skin. It reduced some fine wrinkles and helped with uneven skin.
significant supression of allergy symptoms with the exception of the eyes.
I was experiencing a lot of hot flashes and I think they have subsided in frequency, duration and intensity since starting to take the Lexapro.
I have been suffering from ulceratibe colitis for the past three years, was put on steroids long term, then pentasa granules, then imuran which i had a severe reaction too then cellecept tablets which i had a reaction too also. This drug infliximab is given over two hours into a vein then you are monitored for side effects for approx an hour. My severe pain, feeling of passing out, unable to do a bowel motion without feeling like i am going to die is gone.
I was prescribed Prempro by my OB/GYN for hot flashes. I took one pill a day for over a year. I wento off the Prempro for 3 months and the hot flashes came back, seemed worse than before. I am now back on and have taken 4 days, hot flashes are beginning to get better and hopefully will completely disappear soon!
Quickly helped with depression and nearly eliminated pain soon after starting.  Effects lasted for roughly four months.
It did help with the red blotchy skin that the rosacea was causing and the heat that I would feel when the rosacea would kick in. It also helped with pimples and welts that would sometimes come on during a bought of the rosacea.
I had taken avalox several times before because I had become immune to other antibiotics.  Avalox seemed to work previously.
there was none.
I did not have any other conditions.  Just an inability to focus, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior.  I had a hard time staying organized and difficulty completing tasks.  I also had difficulty staying with one job for too long.  I had a hard time sustaining reading without getting really tired, and I also had a hard time controlling my emotional outbursts.  The  Concerta really helped me control all of those things.
Hair loss all but stopped - kept crown area full.
instantly i felt relieved. i am able to stand back a bit from things that would previously really upset me. i am therefore able not to let things get to me,fantastic. so now i don't  explode instantly in anger at things anymore, i tried to think myself calm and non reactive previously but it did not work. with zoloft i have a calmness when meeting things that would normally make me enraged .i have time and mental space to be rational and realistic and can choose a sane quiet and dignified response, not aggression and anger. hallelujah.
None, presum,ably b/c I had to quit taking the drug before the prescription was completed due to side effects/ possible allergic reaction.
Cleared up smaller papules/pustules and noticeably reduced facial redness. Did nothing for my cystic acne and blackheads.
This was a the easiest birth control that I have ever used, I like the idea of worring about it only once a week
Did not take it long enough for any noticeable benefit.
Through use of the drug and the side effects its produced, I was made much more aware of the level of fat I was consuming with my meals and took measures to reduce the intake
Singulair seemed to work well at controlling my allergies. I the beginning I didn't notice any side effects.
The drug has a very long half life and because of that property there is a long, smooth sustained effect of the drug. I did not feel highs or lows and hardly knew I was taking it except it helped my anxiety.
Seemed to ease allergic rhinitis symptoms caused by seasonal allergies.  Easy administration was a great benefit.
The sores became much less painful very soon, on the 2nd day. Overall, the healing was much faster, and there were only two pills a day to take (not 2 x 3 times a day, like with old-times Acyclovir), which was convenient
Woke up feeling a little less like a zombie, No more insomia.
Needed to replace natural tyroid hormones
none except....slowed heart rate. My afib was NOT diminished, but I assume the drug was helping keep my heart rate when in Afib down somewhat
Dr recomended this for a cold. The traditional decongestants and anti-histimnies had not worked and I was not aware that this allergy medication would have been so effective.
Oxybutynin Chloride reduced my urinary urgency by lessening my bladder spasms, and reduced my urinary frequency, decreasing the number of times I needed to use the bathroom during the day. It also eliminated the need for me to have to get out of bed to void during night.
i believe the medication did assist with depression. By the end of the six month most symptons of depression were gone
Relief and cure of UTI
I felt like I was in a deep dark hole for most of my life, almost immediately after starting the medication I felt like a different human being! I noticed colours for the first time in years and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful sky, grass and flowers. I felt alive, energetic, happy and positive, For the first time in years I wanted to get up in the mornings and LIVE. I wanted to go out in the world again, where as before I hid in my house because of panic attacks. I landscaped my whole garden and when that was done, I decided I wanted to work again and found a job. My marriage flourished after this new me and I fell pregnant 6 months later, at which time I had to discontinue, but that 6 months of Prozac was all it took to give me a new life.
migraine pain relieved in 1 - 2 hours and lasted for 24 hours with 1 tablet
solved my depression and helped me have an overall better outlook on life.
After only three days of treatment my partner noticed a reduction in the hyperpigmentation, it took me about a month to notice these effects. Having used tretinoin now for two months the crepiness under my eyes is greatly reduced, there is undoubtedly a marked improvement in the texture of my skin and the hyperpigmentation is getting better every day.
Oxycodone helped take the major edge off of pain so I could rest. However, it made me so drowsy and felt "out of it" that I would switch to Ibuprofen.
mildly increased attentiveness
Prevented pregnancy, completely cleared up my (moderate) acne.
treatment benefits include migrain pain subsiding in about 20 minutes.  No lingering fuzziness from taking this medication.  Did not make me sleepy. If migrain pain appeared hours later another dose taken.  This drug is especially handy for anyone with pre-menstural migrain headaches
help with pigmentation on the face. acne scar visibly reduced but not all gone.
I was able to walk (although I should not have)and drive in total comfort. All the pain was aleviated throughout the period of time i was taking the tablets. I felt in full control of all of my senses, even though i was a little more relaxed than normal.
Within 30 minutes for injections to 2 hours for caplets I was pain free and functional.





I had gone camping and run out of Imitrex.  I was in pain for about 14 hours when I was taken to a little emergency clinic. They gave me an injection of 50 miligrams and in about 15 minutes I was pain free and feeling normal.
Felt 'normal' rather than in a state of panic and anxiety. Thoughts were clearer and not racing. Felt calm and peaceful.
calming effect, helped with sleep, helped with concentration, reduced appetite, improved depressive symptoms
After taking Adderall XR for about a year, my doctor switched me to Vyvanse.  Vyvanse not only helps me focus and take away the symptoms of ADHD that I was experiencing, but it does so for about 12 hours.  With Adderall XR, the effects lasted only a few hours, and I experienced a crash after the effects wore off and I instantly because extremely cranky and irratable.  With Adderall XR, I also lost the desire to eat.  I am hungry with Vyvanse, and do have the desire to eat.  With Vyvanse, I do not feel the crash at the end of the day, and I do not experience any moodiness.  I am very please with this drug, and it has changed my life for the better.  I have reccommended it to other family members with the same problems that I have and they have shared with me similar success stories.
In the case of a panic attack, this would soothe the anxiety and calm me down-a numbing sensation--a highly effective anti-psychotic in several situations--kept a low-level feeling of calmness and barrier to anxiety/stress
much lower cholesterol
lowered lipid levesl
Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.
Hello all !


Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription.
None. The Cipro appeared not to work for my skin infection.
had been converned abvout hair loss for several years (i think when i stopped taking birth control pills!)  so thought it was hormonal.   Hormones didn't help.   The armour did reduce hair loss
The first few days I felt "happier"
I do still see reduction in the papules but the redness is still there. In fact, I am wondering if I am developing an immunity because the redness seems to be worsening. Also my skin seems to be getting more sensitive n general.
I could breathe, and if I took it before exercise, I wouldn't need it during.
Very quck and long lasting erection. Have been able to have sexual intercorse for 2-3 days no problem. That also had a psychological effect of easing anxiety.
controls asthma by controling my allergies.  The allergies subsided and my ashtma does not kick in I have allergic onset asthma , typically caused by pert dander or huge climate changes .  Like going from the South texas area where I live to Oklahoma in the winter when its cold there
None
I began to notice the positive benefits within a few weeks.  My mood brightened, I stopped feeling grief and self-loathing, began to remember what I liked to do. I also had increased ability to concentrate, increased energy, increased sex drive.   I was no longer depressed.  I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years, and the symptoms of depression did not return.
It itnitially helped a great deal. The first 2 days I slept and I felt really good for a change. My aches and pains seemed to vanish. I had energy and felt motivated. My "quick to aggravate" temperment diminished as well.
helped anxiety & black moods, headaches.  Made my life a happier place to be in, especially for my family.  Have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain.
My rosacia and acne were improved 60% by the drug but I believe that the Murad Skin Care line for acne helped more than the drug.  I used both daily, first the drug for 3 mo. then the Murad for 3 mo.  The Murad appeared to help more without any negative side effects. My skin on the drug was very sensitive to sunlight but not with the Murad treatment.
The drug was to prevent further infections which were starting to scar the kidneys. After taking the drug my daughter did not have any more infections. it was a low level dose and did not seem to affect her in any way e.g causing digestive problems.
We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control.
made my daughter less anxious
Greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof.
The viral load count was reduced from millions to less than a hundred within 9 months. Though the virus cannot be completely removed, reduction in number helped my physiological health in addition to the physical. I've been continuing taking the drugs, and would likely continue until 2 years.
Extreme urticaria (hives) on forearms and mild (hives) on face and legs were near completely cured with the Zantac.
My stomach aches went away. I wasn't as nauseated as I would have been without anything.
Significantly decreased depression and anxiety. More effective than Lexapro which was also taken prior by patient. Definitely a more effective product.
Stabalized mood, decreased fatigue, better outlook on life.
Completely cleared resistant adult cystic acne that had not responded to any topical meds or to Accutane.
Increased alertness  throughout the day with increased sleep quality. I still have to take naps in my car on some days, but overall this medicine is working great for me.
reduction of daily muscle tension headaches to about one headache every 6-7 days with decreased severity
reduced acne
Blood pressure numbers decreased significantly. Had headaches in the past, most likely due to high blood pressure - no longer having any problems with headaches.
None at all; my acne went from mild to severe. I woke up everyday with big new, painful whiteheads. Each time a group of pimples went away, several new ones formed immediately. I also have oily skin, and I read that Retin-A rapidly reduces oil; my skin is just as oily as the day I started and my acne is as bad as when I was a teenager.
Strong erections
I took the Keflex before my dental apppointment because of Mitral Valve Prolapse.  I did not get a heart infection.
Clear appearance of skin, decreased pimples and cysts, it took one month for the medication to start working and had moderate effects
Hair came back from a thinning status and a visible scalp through the hair to a much thicker condition with little visible scalp through the hair..


confidence back. i no longer look older than i feel and think my overall esteem has been improved
It has the effect of major Reduction in anxiety, it produces alot of calmness, able to function properly, they pills cured insomnia, it made me get less sever panic attacks, reduction and or elimination of panic attacks, it improveded mood.It was the best drug for panic attacks
able to think more clearly and remember things and not so depressed. could function more stable -- began to get more done like in years past. the night sweats from pre menapausal symptoms seemed to go away almost totally; it gave me more hope and not so effected by negative circumstances. I was able to move on with life and function like a normal person
I noticed significant smoothing and softening of lines on face, lightening of uneven coloring, reduction of frequency of blemishes, reduction in oiliness of skin and some tightening of the tissues of the facial skin.  I would hope that the effects are long-lasting, but I have only used it for 2 months now.
relief
relieved depressive symptoms; not as weepy or anxious, did NOT interfere with libido/sexual performance; slight decrease in appetite (pt liked wt loss)
The Ibuprofen helped relieve pain and swelling from the sprained ankle. It lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain. Swelling was substantially lowered after a week period and steps were taken to allow the ankle to regain flexibility due to subsiding of pain.
lower blood pressure in combination with Hyzaar
I first tried ibuprofen 800 mg with very little results other than upset stomach between epidural treatments (3) i
The hair loss stopped in 2 weeks, I am almost even sure that I have growth again on the area where I lost hairs. The effect were visble really quickly and I do not see any sort side effects as of now.
Having had severe TPM symptoms for many years, I asked my doctor for Fluoxetine. The benefits were a total feeling of "well-being". Without the extreme "high" feeling of anfetamines (taken before as part of a supervised diet regimen). High decrease on anxiety. Appetite more controled. Clearness of my thoughts. Decrease on crisis of depression (specially during the days previous to my periods). More "energy" during the day to the daily things.. decrease on obsessive compulsive (mild) disorder
I have a bad case of Crohn's disease.  Mine is fibrostenotic crohn's.  I had a stricture that was causing my pain, but severe bathroom visits.  The stricture was fixed with surgery.  The frequency of the bathroom visits is lessend with Remicade.  It helps within 1 to 1 1/2 weeks.  The only bad thing is that I find myself needing it desparately at 7 weeks.  I suffer for 2 weeks then until I can get it and let it start working again.
Prevention of blood clot formation after angiogram. The angiogram was required as the patient (myself) has a calcium score of about 4000 (extremely high) and had  complained of minor episodes of intermittent weakness in the hands and feet. The angiogram revealed a number of partial arterial blockages being treated first with Lipitor and currently with Crestor, niacin and aspirin.
anxiety and nervousnees diappeared. was able to engage in social activities with no fear.was mor functional on the job, procrastination and econd guessing myself was to a minimal. low self esteem was elevated , did not have such a poor view of myself. i felt calm and confident
recoverd from loose motions. nothing more to add. thanks nothing more to add. thanks nothing more to add. thanks nothing more to add. thanks nothing more to add. thanks nothing more to add. thanks
headache stopped
Seroquel knocks you out, but for me it takes about 2 hours to start working. I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams. Seroquel has an amazing ability to erase memories of the day before, which for me is usually a good thing. Highly recommended for people with severe insomnia and/or rapid mood swings.
Primarily, my son was much better able to focus, control his impulsivity and, as a result, did better in school.  Our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper, which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could.
less irritability, slept better. Was less hungry.
pain relief, which gave me energy to get through the day and able to work
Marked reduction in redness & flushing and complete elimination of pustules.  Ease of use over creams, etc.
The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.
My acne has completely dminished...i have the occasional break-out, but on a an everyday consistent basis i am now acne-free due to Retin-A!  It helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it, however after a few weeks off, the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began.
I landed in a West African hospital with my insides coming out and suffering from the worst stomach pain as a result of (probably) eating bad food. I vomited for 12 hours until I got the drip and then I was okay for the next couple days in the hospital (although the stomach pains remained).





Cipro is also the god of beating Urinary tract infections: I've taken both a 3 and 5 day course, and its been effective instantly.
I did not experience any benefits after one week of usage.  I chose to discontinue the treatment.
Treatment cleared the complexion from acne breakout and eliminated the redness/residual under the skin.  This drug had an almost immediate effect on the facial and back areas of the patient.  If the patient stopped taking the minocycline, the acne almost immediately returned.  It kept the bacteria at bay while on the medication.
Lunesta helped me sleep the first few times I took them and gave me 5-6 hours of sleep without waking up every hour (like I normally do without taking it).
None really.  At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep.
I did not experience the "brain-fog" that I did with Celexa. I felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely.
Mood more level. My speech is slower, not as pressured. I tend to listen better. I feel more "chill", though I still do experience free floating anxiety. My mood is significantly improved, but the anxiety, while lower, is the most stubborn of the symptoms.
There were no treatment benefits from this particular drug.   My nausea was not controlled at all, in fact I felt more nauseaus after taking the medication.
The bone mass in my spine improved.   One hip was stable and one had lower bone density
The benefits are helping to control my cystic acne. I used to have very painful acne cysts that caused major scarring on my cheeks and chin. I did use accutane for about 4 months to clear it up. However, I still breakout. Not with cysts but smaller pimples. They seem to form in a cluster in certain areas. I have tried all kinds of topical as well as oral medication to keep these breakouts at bay. Spironolactone has pretty much helped reduce the breakouts to almost non existant. My face is also less oily.
I became a happier person and felt like living and being active again. I was a better mother and wife. I could focus and was not lethargic or sad.
Lessened anxiety,brought about more attention
getting rid of plaque and the redness and itchiness and the ugly sight of it. being able to wear short sleeve shirts in the summer
Reduce anxiety and panic. Able to ride subways and go into


crowded areas without fear of panic attack


flying is now much easier because the fair of having a 


panic attack is not there
Since I've started the treatment, my tension has stabilized. I've monitored it quite frequently after beginning the treatment to see assess the progress. It seems to also have an impact on my ability to maintain a lower blood pressure than before during physical activities.
TSH numbers brought down to normal levels, seemed to improve constipation, dry skin and cold intolerance
My blood sugar is under control. I went from an A1c of over 8.0 to an A1c of 5.3 over the course of treatment. This medication has had minimal side effects and I developed a tolerance to the side effects in a short period of time- about 30 days. This medication is easy to take and doesn't dissolve on your tongue thus avoiding a bitter pill taste. In its generic form this medication is quite affordable.
to be honest, I am uncertain yet. I believe it will take months to see results
TSH went up to 51 when put on low dose of natural thyroid. Doing better on synthroid rather than generic brand.  Still have fatigue, memory, weight loss problems.  I believe there are things that the blood tests do not show. Not freezing anymore.
lowered blood pressure
After the first few DAYS my anxiety was greatly reduced. I felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that I had been having prior to starting this medication. I was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression.
This works very well for mild to moderate pain, usually caused by over-exertion, and charaterized by muscle soreness, spasms, cramps, tightness
My hair loss that I was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks, and I actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey, that's science, man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on.
There were not any benefits.  Galderma changed metrogel and the new formula didn't agree with my skin.
The oral disintegrating formulation of zofran is very easy to take, especially


in cases of severe nausea.
None. though suffering terrible pain from shingles, this drug cause a severe adverse reaction and necessitated calling an ambulance. It created sever pain in another site entirely, so effectively doubled my trouble.
The medicine was taken to prevent infection since a hole was drilled to drain the gathered blood and release pressure on my nail bed.  As a result, I am in the process of regrowing a healthy nail.
To minimize manic depression, patient was having problems at work, can't sleep well, this drug helped to calm patient down, becoming more relaxed, able to deal with normal work load.
No benefits, only very bad side effects (see below)
I find Adderall compared to other ADD meds to work most efficiently to help me focus and give me drive and motivation to stay on task without the jitters found in some ADD meds. Helps control anxiety
better mood, loss of appetite,weight reduction. Lost 14lbs. in 2 months.
Fingers didn't turn white for as long or as often as they used to.  However, my fingers are still a shade of blue, and hands are still cold.  My face still changes colors throughout the day, from pale, to blue, to red.  It helped, but not enough.  The doctor has prescribed 30mg Nifedipine to see if that works better.
Since my hypothyroidism is being better treated I rarely get a migraine anymore. I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects, but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too, especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too.
complete improvement in flat sad affect.  Felt depression completely lift by the end of four weeks.
continuation of hormone replacement after stopping birth control pills


No hot flashes or night sweats.
Cured ingrown toenails, straighter growing nails, whiter, clearer nails.
I felt the cream was helpful.  Once the intitial effects were seen, they seemed to level out.  I used the cream nightly as I did not wear it during the day.  My skin felt smooth and soft after the first week.
This ia a life altering medication for me.  I get occaisional migraines due to hormonal changes, allergy and weather changes.  This medication stops a severe headache and it rarely returns.  It works within about an hour.  It stops a migraine that may last for two days at times.  I am not a big fan of taking medications but this one is a miracle drug.
Within 3 weeks I noticed a "lifting " of mood and a general sense of being more energized and interested in everyday activities. I was far less concerned about things which had previously worried me and felt more enabled to engage in social activities again.
The benefits of taking this drug were a slow down in mpb (male pattern baldness). I noticed that less hairs in the M shape were falling out. It also regrew some of the hair that was lost for several years ago in the crown area. I also noticed that thin, weak hairs regrew stronger and thicker.
both seem to work well but looking for something over the counter that helps sleeping so i dont have to take the prescription med. to sleep. it is too expensive. it also would  take a hour or so for it to work. then if i woke up later i had to take another one to go back to sleep. so i am trying to find a good over the counter sleep medicine to take instead.
some control of partial seizures- they decreased from 3-4/wk to 1-2/mo
Eliminated severe pain post surgery
Most of the pain was alleviated even though I continued to run daily.    Some returned when I stopped the drug.
the pain in my tooth started to subside
a reduction in the amount of panic attacks i suffered, and more control over the ones i do have, a general lightening of moods and outlook. my IBS symptoms appear reduced.
The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.
It did lower my BP some
After a few weeks my skin started to clear up and look my younger and clearer.  I did experience some tightening in my skin and dryness.  Also, I was instructed not to apply any moisturizer to my t-zone since that is my problem ares.
If I have a classical migraine, I cannot function without taking an Imitrex. Imitrex takes the edge off the pain, takes away the feeling of nausea and I am able to work on the computer, which I otherwise could not do with a migraine. The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex.
completely relieved acid reflux and eliminated all symptons such as heartburn, cough, etc.


completely relieved acid reflux and eliminated all symptons such as heartburn, cough, etc.


completely relieved acid reflux and eliminated all symptons such as heartburn, cough, etc.
No benefits whatsoever, no change in bone density. I took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as I prepared for work. The side effects were numerous and severe, and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone, and would have to make every attempt to save myself.
full long lasting erection up to two days after 20mg dosage,plus it works when you are ready, i must say it brings you back to your youth.
Helped me easily get a good sleep. Possible reduction in IBS symptoms.
Slowed the hair loss and thickened the hair somewhat...pretty good I thought !
I didn't notice dramatic results with this product and it was fairly expensive at $100 for one tube. I wasn't religious about applying it each day, so that might have had an impact on the effectiveness. I didn't notice significant fading of the darkest large freckles on my face as I had hoped. I didn't notice any significant reduction in wrinkles.
After the administration of the first injection the pain decreased, however after a period of two weeks it returned. A second injection was administered. There was no improvement and undesirable side effects, as described below, appeared.
After taking the Zyban for 3 weeks my desire to smoke was nearly eliminated. I had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! Unfortunately I had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient Wellbutrin).
Early this year I started noticing my skin around the eye beginning to lose its firmness: wrinkles formed during sleep could not be smoothed out by using Lancome eye cream.  Though, applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids, but only on the surface, and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now), the wrinkles are smoothed, and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up, supple and elastic.
Reduced blood pressure and stopped cholestrol from forming in my arteries.
I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.
decreased ER visits due to control of the migraine at onset.  Lower stress level with the migraine due to medications quick action.
None.
none
not worth the cost of the side effects.  Becasue I was so miserable, I discontinued the medication early and opted for a more conventional anti-biotic.
I stayed loose and limber throughout the day.  Didn't end up limping at the end of the day or after a 30 min car ride.  It made me feel like I was in my 30's again instead of my 50's.  It enables me to do yoga moves which I could not do because of the pain.  It's changed my life.  None of the side effects that narcotic pain relievers give.  No tiredness or spaciness
none, the sinus condition remained after a short trial of the Levaquin.  I had to resort to a regular Z-pak.
improve cystic acne on chin -- I still get a few bumps but not as many or as violent as before the treatment.
Lowered his blood pressure with one pill to the point of passing out, and having severe cramping.
None YET
Skin cleared up immediately - the first time.
None
the treatments benifits are to reduce acid reflux and stop acid from forming in the stomach.
I am able to breath more easily. Taking the medication keeps my airways open and keeps me alive.
Mega-dosage of Valtrex upon the first symptoms and signs of a cold sore typically effectively reduced and or eliminated the actual appearance and break out of cold sores.
Zithromax quickly improved my bacterial sinus infection and allowed me to keep my travel plans for day 2 of treatment.  It worked amazingly fast in alleviating my symptoms.
Calmed Anxiety - Was having 4-6 anxiety attacks daily. Helped to stabilize my mood.


Slept at least 7 hours - Initially was started on sleeping pills. Would wake up around 5 times a night. With the Seroquel I only wake up a couple times a night.
Taking the medicine was only once a day at the time I chose to take it. It helped me most during stressed situations of any size. I could handle anything and not get angry.
It exfoliated my skin.
my experience with zyprexa has been very positive. it really saved my life.


i am able to think very clearly now.
Most say it takes 6 weeks for this drug to really be in your system. After taking for 3 days I could feel the effects, I was much calmer and able to handle stressful situations, and back to myself. My problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. I am now much more able to let small things roll off my back.
Reduction of oral prednisone and prednisone eyedrops w/ eventual stoppage. Uveitis cleared. Inflammatory arthritis is ongoing. I am undergoing new treatment with MTX currently.
I do feel much more awake, but I still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued, but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage, and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.
My hair had been falling out, and it finally stopped after taking this for a while.  Now it is growing back and getting thicker.  Before I was always cold and my hands would even get numb from being so cold all the time.  Now I am finally warm and don't have to wear a sweater  in the summer.
Completely eliminated neck pain. Interestingly, did not reduce slight-to-moderate left hip pain (see article on pain in 11/09 issue of Scientific American)
I don't have to worry about forgetting to take a pill or a condom breaking.  I have had no vaginal dryness,my sex drive is still the same (high), no cramping, matter of fact, I was cramping very badly the day that I started the ring and within an hour of insertion, my cramps went away.  I actually had blood clots before I started the ring, and now my periods are so much more lighter so I am not clotting at all. :)  Also, my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  I think it's AWESOME!!  My partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)!
cleared head and sinsus
Relieved Gerd symptoms.
almost complete elimination of gerd symptoms--reflux,heartburn,nausea,choking spasms, cough.  I have also been able to eat a wider variety of foods without discomfort.
Increase in energy, immediate weight loss.
better outlook on life in general, less anxious, easier to deal with everything, a difference of night and day
I used this cream very religiously. I was very particular about avoiding sun which is a must with thos medication.. I have to say that I have gotten rid of my pigmentation. My skin is very smooth and it also takes cate of ocassional breakout. My pore size has become smaller.
The pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. The medication relived the pain , nearly completlly, and allowed the spasms to subside. I tried anti inflamatories before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. Strong pain killers like darvocet and vicadin are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use.
Apparently prevented wound infection, though efficacy of drug is questionable and causality cannot be established.
Nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours. Lisinopril allowed both myself and my partner to sleep at night. Somehow, the drug works without the adverse effects the other sleeping pills, neuro transmiter pills and anti-depressants had.
Singulair appeared to help somewhat with being able to breathe better.


Rhinitis was decreased.  It helped me miss fewer work days, especially when air index quality was poor.
The medicine did help with the pain.
I have increased energy while taking this medication. It has possibly prevented osteoporosis. My family is quite prone to this, and my bone density tests only show slight osteopenia.
Blood sugar levels returned to within normal limits.  The risk of having to become insulin dependent for my diabetes was decreased.
only 4 periods a year
I haven't noticed any benefits
Very effective in treating wrinkles by relaxing muscles - highly recommend by trained professional.  No down time, immediate results.  Very pleased with the outcome.
Increased interest and enthusiasm in activities.
Since using the Retin-A along with the Accutane, I have noticed a great improvement in the look of my skin.  There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes.
I noticed at first with the 150mg a boost in energy, and more regular sleeping habits. At the 300mg upgrade shortly into month two I went from smoking a pack a day (25 cigarettes) to about 3. My boyfriend smokes also which is why I still have a few a day. Also after smoking pot it's nice to have a smoke I find.
sleep
Addition of neurontin reduced overall pain severity at the neuropathic injury site (R cervical spine), and appeared to lessen a qualitatively different component of the pain to that helped by tramadol. Combination of tramadol and neurontin in carefully tested comination (to suit patient) brought best pain result to date (injury 26mo prior).
For the first time in years I woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. I woke up feeling rested, awake, alert. Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me.
reduction of asthma symptoms and severity, less shortness of breath and light headedness
Quick relief of hypertension, moving from 150/120 area down to 130/80 region.
significant decrease to nerve pain to arm
It worked great! I would not be nauseated at all and could eat and have energy all day.
Fter going back to the doctors for a nother swob the bacterial number was back to normal
lowered blood pressure to within normal limits
Aided in decreasing symptoms of depression, and also reduced craving for cigarettes as a bonus.  Noticeably less lethargy.
Benefits: Patch applied 1x weekly assured consistent delivery of dosage. No skin irritation reported by patient but recommended that site used be rotated weekly. Patch can come off if not applied correctly to clean dry skin - no lotions or creams s/b present. May not be metabolized through liver as much as oral estrogen - advantage.
reduced blood pressure to within acceptable limits. replaced previous drug (ACE inhibitor) with undesirable side effects.
cleared acne rosacea.
Slight initial improvement of viral aggravated asthma.
helped me sleep well
Absolutely none
First of all there are a TON of competitors like rogaine on these reviews bashing propecia, how can you only take it for 3 months and have side effects that have ruined your life, i find that highly unlikely. Second, propecia does work even for a receding hairline, if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you won't. I have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time.
improved range of motion, pain relief and decreased soreness
When I apply this cream on the infected area, It sometimes relives the pain in few seconds, or few mins. It is a symtomatic temporary relief. But the allergy repeats itself few months later.
I was taking Flexeril for muscle inflammation in my ribs caused by sever coughing from bronchitis.  It helped with the pain a lot and helped me sleep through the night.
The treatments stopped my monthly acne breakouts.  This allowed my skin to heal and broke the breakout cycle.  My skin has not wrinkled as fast as my friends of the same age.
Compared with synthroid that was prescribed to me in the beginning, I have fewer problems, like mood swings, sweating, weight gain, etc.
None
It relieved the actual pain of my inflammed stricture
Synthroid aggravated my hives, tremendously.
The pain was definitely reduced, from high discomfort to relatively low discomfort, so long as I wasn't moving. It also helped me to sleep some of the time.
This cleared up severe cracking and bleeding on hand. I have managed to avoid the condition for many months due to proper moisturization.
Amoxicillin did little, if any, good for the infection I had with my abcessed tooth. I also had a skin lesion caused by a bacteria, per the doctor, but Amoxicillin did not effect this at all. It stayed the same through the days I took this antibiotic.
Able to move easier, not in as much pain, more energy, sleeping better, mood is stable.
infection cleared up in a week
Took 25mg for insomnia for about 3 weeks. Did not notice a difference. The Doctor Prescribed 50mg, and still no difference. Finally, I was prescribed 75mg and have been taking that dosage for about 2 months.I do sleep a little better than before, but I still do not sleep through the whole night.
Acne significantly reduced or disappeared, but returns immediately upon stopping treatment.
The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.
I feel better about myself and less anxious and depressed.
the benefit was a lowering of blood sugar and metformin does that very well without leading to hypoglycemia which can happen with some of the other anti-hyperglycemic drugs.
no watery itchy eyes, no runny stuffy nose. no sneezing. Normally my eyes are sticky and itchy and I sneez unconrtoallably. Also y nose woudl get completely stuffy and drip water constantly.
The prednisone immediately reduced the warmth and burning heat of the rash, although the rash continued to spread across my face for several days. It also stopped the itching. As another benefit, the prednisone also got rid of my eczema and--most thrilling--my tennis elbow, which was lingering from 9 months earlier!
I feel much more stabilized on this drug. However the 200 mg.did quit working after about year and a half, and I was hospitalized with a mixed episode. My Lamictal was raised to 400 mg. 200 at night and 200 in the AM. I am told this is the highest theraputic level for this drug for treating bi-polar. I am much more even but am also still on Geodon and kolonpin once a day. I am weaning off of zoloft-am at 50 mg. once a day at moment. I feel the real med that has helped is the Lamictal, I hope to wean off the rest of meds after being stable for a length of time.
Incredibly beneficial! By using the semi-synthetic opioid dreug along with a homeopathic, long used in europe product, Traumeel (HEEL, Inc.) my osteoarthistis and other spinal pain issues were substanially relieved on a 24 hr basis.
Seasonique was great for me as a birth control method instead of condoms and I experienced no spotting or bleeding the whole 3 months before my period.
this medication allowed patient to reduce other cholesterol lowering medications while still keeping high cholesterol under control
I could fall asleep and was usually well rested.
I was finally able to get the deep sleep that I needed to function. Other problems that I have- Interstitial Cystitis, Fibromyalgia, Insomnia, etc.- seem to be improving because of the sleep that I am getting.
It reduced my acne considerably. It provided a very smooth feeling to my skin that I did not experience with anything prior to using this medicine. It also gave me a rosier complexion with a glow.
I had several episodes of extremely high blood pressure 212/90 was one reading.  It was mainly a product of work related stress and being overweight.  First I was treated with Prozac for the depression/anxiety and became suicidal.  With the Paxil and Lisinopril combination my blood pressure is controlled and I do not suffer from depression nor anxiety.  I respond to outside stimuli in a more normal way.
Absolutely none. This drug destroyed my marriage. I was so irrationally angry over really stupid stuff. I was raging at my husband for no reason. And it made our marriage crazy to the point that we separated and divorced. I have been told this drug does cause anger in perfectly normal people and that it is like being on speed or cocaine. I would pull this drug from the market.
My anger and depression seemed to get much better within 3 weeks of starting on 75 mg. My dose was eventually increased over time to 150mg.  My family noticed a difference in my attitude.
Before taking Prozac I had no energy or joy - I could barely lift my head off the pillow in the morning. I just wanted to stay in bed. When I first started taking it, I could feel it physically - I felt a little "giddy" and my eyes felt/looked glazed. But over time, those feelings went away and I just felt normal. I no longer felt like I was on a drug - I just felt good. I could get up in the morning and looked forward to each day.
depression reduced - I had taken it at a lower dosage at first - but his had no effect - at all - so psychiatrist had to prescribe a higher dosage than the family doctors are allowed...the effect was amazing - I suddenly felt a 100% better after  a week or so - I had been on the lower dosage for months with no effect.
So far I've been sad to say the the side effects are worse for him. I want to continue the drug longer to hope that the side effects will decrease.
It was able to supress my hunger enough to "get through" the tough times and not be so grumpy about it :)  Simply, I was not STARVING all the time, and it made the weight loss bearable.  It was not EASY, but it gave me the drive to keep going because I wasn't so miserable while doing it. I ate a 1200 calorie a day or less diet and exercised many times a week...so I would have lost weight anyway, but it just made it easier.
Infection gone.
This product reduced the severity of the breakouts and reduced length of time of the acne outbreak.  It was effective in reducing the outbreak but it does not eliminate or reduce blackheads unless an inordinate amount of ointment is applied daily.
This medication is manufactured to lower the bad cholesterol levels.


Therefore it is produced to dicrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. After first month of usage the blood test should be performed . The dosage shall be adjusted accordingly and another three months treatment shall follow before another bloood test is done.
The side affects were not so bad. The pills were easy to take, and got them from Publix so they were vanilla flavored.
The benefits are numerous. With the Geodon I haven't suffered from a bout of depression in app. 2 1/2 yrs.. Before the Geodon I suffered from depression for months at a time. I haven't been or felt suicidal at all since beginning the drug. With Geodon I am on an even keel. By that I mean that I do not suffer from the peaks and valleys of typical bi-polar disorder. I no longer have manic episodes for days and then sink into a dark depression. It has made most of my bi-polar traits go away.
Catapres was initially effective at reducing my blood pressure on it's own, but there was reduced effectiveness over time. For this reason I began taking Betaloc in addition to catapres (daily). Taking these two drugs together has resulted in good blood pressure control with a fairly low dose of each drug.





A side benefit of taking catapres has been that it helps to control my Rosacea symptoms. I have had the reason for this explained to me, but cannot recal the details (has something to do with Catapres effect on the sympathetic nervous system).
This dosage works in keeping bladder irritations almost completely non-existent.


Before beginning this treatment I had recurring bladder irritations that felt like a bladder infection.  When tested, there was never any bacteria present.  The urologist that I went to put me on this system of using a vaginal cream.  I began using it nightly until symptoms were relieved or disappeared.  Following that I was put on a regimen of using the vaginal cream only 3 nights per week.  


Without the premarin vaginal cream I consistently had vaginal irritations.
I can now fly without flight or pre-flight anxiety. I used to worry for two weeks about getting ono and airplane.
Quick relief of flu-like symptoms
reduced sore throats and headaches due to allergies
Reduced the blood pressure with few side effects at first
Virtually no pain.
Very effective increase of HDL
For migraines related to my menstrual cycle, zomig has been the most effective


drug to treat/minimize the migraine symptoms.  With the option of taking 1/2, I could start at this lower dose and try to take it as soon as it was clear a migraine was setting in.  I typically could control it over several days if needed with periodic 1/2 dose.
I felt great. Highly effective at preventing pregnancy. My skin looked decent while on the pill as well. I had a doctor tell me once that this pill was one the best birth controls to use. I agree, seeing as I am the patient. Its always nice to know when to expect your period :)
Between 1998 and 2006, when I was going through menopause, my bone density went from normal to borderline osteoporosis, as shown by the results of two bone density tests given on those dates. After I received my bone density results in 2006, my physician put me on Fosamax, which I have taken regularly for the past two years.  When I took a bone density test recently in 2008, my bone mineral density had increased by almost 6% over a two-year period. I remain in the range of osteopenia, but am midway now between normal and osteoporosis in my T-scores.
Signifigantly reduced depression, social anxiety. Mild side effects.
The benifit of taking the drug was to decrease the symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, the drug did not suppress the libido on the opposite it increase the sexual desire.
The bacterial infection in the prostate was quickly controlled, immediately .
While taking this medicine for sleep disorder IT help Me very good. I discovered


 It help another problem I had for many Years. I had a sinus problem of sever running noes every time I ate My nose would run like a faucet. Now it slowed down to a trickle.Hope It will Help someone else who suffer with this problem.
I have more energy, the want to do things (clean house, walk, and normal daily activities). It boosts my self confidence. I am more happy now. I have more fun with my 2 children. I have no appetite what so ever, which to me is an awesome thing whereas before I could eat my 3 meals a day and snack a million times in between. I actually like the taste of water now. I didn't drink pop much at all before but now if I take a drink of pop it tastes nasty so that is a very big plus.
I lost 90 pounds in 6 months. The key was drinking water all throughout the day. I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce, fruit cups, canned fruit,etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food, icecream, chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month, but once 30 days had passed, I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia, I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose!
Reduced depression and feelings of hopelessness within 3 weeks. I like being able to increase dosage when things get a little rough and then back off to the original dosage when things settle down.
Tried many different drugs all either failed to reduce my blood presure or had side effects which I did not want to live with. Hytrin has brought my blood pressure under control with absolutely no side effects
Flare-ups were less frequent as well and the duration of time they lasted was less. I noticed that it didn't help with the amount of bowl movements I was having but it did help stop the internal bleeding.
Very limited for the amount taken.  New bone density showed slight improvement, ie 2 years ago spine was -3.3, now is -2.9.
The synthetic thyroid hormone treatment made it so I was at least able to function, sped my metabolism up enough to keep warm and have regular menses.
My miracle drug!! I have suffered for years with extreme mood swings, depression, and bulimia. It was several months ago that I was diagnosed with bipolar 2-I was immediately prescribed Lamictal-I didn't really notice a difference so my dr. upped it to 150mg. It has worked wonders! I am so proud to say that I am happy and I haven't felt this elation in years! I can actually stay awake during the day, I have the drive to exercise, my labido is back(sure did miss that), almost no mood swings at all and most importantly I feel like a mother again! I have 3 beautiful little girls that I can hug, kiss, and love again!! I feel like crying-in a good way-everytime I think about how happy I am! My only fear is wondering how long this will last-I can only pray this will last forever.
Became less emotional and therefore able to function better in everyday settings,especially as I experienced no side-effects.
The effect of the drug starts immediately but still the care is needed in the food. The drug is also inexpensive and widely available in the drug store.
After my hysterectomy, I was depressed, didn't want to have company, was suspicious of everyone and everything. I wasn't feeling like my former self at all.  Once I began the hormone replacement therapy (Premarin), I began to feel much better immediately.  The depression left and I felt younger and much more able to cope with daily life.  I take Premarin (.625mg) daily.
not noticable, supposed to clear all yeast from body because I had been feeling bloated, kept getting yeast infections and when I had colonics the lady told me that I had an abundance of yeast.  Makes sense cuz I drink a lot of beer and don't eat too healthy.
Treatment began to work after 3 days. I had not been able to smell for 10 years and my smell is now restored.
the treatment (eyes & forehead) was highly effective and lasted 6 months each of the 3 times I was treated. I have a very deep vertical line between my eyes which was all but invisible with each treatment. I loved it!
The only positive effects was blood pressure moderately controlled.
Tried to stop smoking for years. Started using Chantix and found that if taken twice daily even if I smoked an occassional cigarettes; I continued to take the drug. Had no jitters or nervousness from nicotine withdrawals. Very effective.
This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.
I used to have near-daily migraines.  I tried every migraine medication on the market.  Either they didn't have any effect, or I was unable to tolerate them due to side-effects.  With Botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist, I am virtually migraine-free for months.
Opened lungs when breathing was difficult.
My worst symptom was in my feet. It was painful to walk, and therefore I walked slowly even when I used shoes with good support (Birkenstocks), especially going down stairs. There was some pain or discomfort in my lower back. These were my symptoms when I was on methotrexate alone. When I started Enbrel, I felt the effects within hours. Within the same day I could walk decently with much less pain. Within the next few days and weeks, I'm practically back to normal. In my second month, I think I started to feel a tapering off of its effects, which doctors warned me about and I read about: I felt a faint shadow of the foot pains I used to experience but I can still move normally.
The Lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken, I'm hurt.  I have children at home, I need to at least be mobile!
I have taken this drug off and on for the past 13 years. I have always had good results with it, but I wanted to go off it to have children. Then, after my last child, I tried to make it without medication, but I realized I couldn't. I am very careful about the medications I take and I don't like being stuck on anything. However, I realized that I needed help and my children needed a happy Mommy. I went back on Prozac (the generic form) 2 months ago and now feel better than I have in years. I can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper, or my mind. I can face the responsibilities of each day without fear, hopelessness, or doubt. I can laugh and enjoy my children. I am truly a new person. I am regretting not going back on this medication sooner.
I am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels. It's kind of strange, as they've only were back in range, when i stopped taking l-thyroxine.
Montelukast stopped the constant recession leading to repeated hospital admissions
the drug treatments stopped the headaches.
Had a lot of headaches all day every day. Doctor said it was tension headaches made by a muscle spasm in my neck. She prescribe this medicine and the headaches are hardly there.
Was able to sleep for seven hours at night without waking up.
Was able to get to sleep and stay asleep for a full eight hours.  Could go to sleep within an hour of taking the drug and was able to still wake up the next day. I take one benadryl with the xanax to help get the sleep cycle started.
none
It did lower my blood pressure, although my physician wanted to lower it further because I started out on 10 mg a day so the medication doseage was raised to 20 mg which as been more effective at lowering my blood pressure.  Even though my blood pressure wasn't dangerously high since cardiovascular issues run in my family my doctor wanted me to take this drug because of family history even though I am young.
This drug improved my mood greatly. I can take more stress at work, in my romantic life, and family situations where as before, I would crawl under a rock and cry. A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug, but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs. It helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating.
Made a huge difference in my depression (post natal) at first. Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy, which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially.
This drug turned my severe recurrent depression around.
I didn't get malaria
revieved my eyes of the redness and puffiness and fluid that had been coming out of my eyes.
This did help clear acne infections and helped skin somewhat improve
Pain and pressure in front temporal lobes was reduced 50% within 2 hours of initial treament. Within 4 hours an overall 80% reduction in symptom severity.
reduction in allergy symptons-  less nasal congestion, and itchiness in eyes was reduced--
Lessened the pain associated with the inflamation
-stop smoking
Male to Female transformation   fat re-distribution, breasts and fat alterations in the face. In my case the feminine side was a more slender face
My skin cleared considerably in about two weeks after starting this medication and has remained relatively clear over the 10 months i have been taking it.  I have far fewer hormonal breakouts around my chin and my skin seems generally less congested with fewer blackheads.  I have also noticed a reducation in oil on the surface of my skin.
The treatment stopped hair loss and caused some regrowth. Some loss of effectiveness (I beieve due to worsening of underlying condition), but adding a topical solution corrected this.
Brought me out of a severe, didn't-care-if-I-lived depression without making anxiety too much worse. Not perfect but works well enough that I don't want to quit taking.
STOPPED THE SYMPTOMS OF ULCERATVE COLITIS W/I 2 WEEKS
skin cell turnover increases
The treatment was very effective in producing an erection when sexualy stimulated.
Reduce the chance of ostheoporiosis
Treatment benefits included prevention of pregnancy, clearer, more manageable skin, reduced menses and significantly reduced cramps. I never had another huge cystic acne after taking this medication. I had very VERY tiny acne occasionally. I mainly went to the doctor for heavy cramps. Now each month I do not suffer from cramps and am very happy.
Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant, or not monitored by your doctor, Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.
I feel more level, able to think and concentrate, less stressed and not bothered about anything.
Decreased sputum production and increased lung function.
Markedly decreased hot flashes, which allowed for better sleep. Reversal of vaginal atrophy symptoms and vaginal dryness, and the accompanying itching and irritation.
have gone without a headache or migraine for 3 weeks now.  I have very mild neck pain.
Helped ease depressed mood, less mood swings. Better overall sense of well being. I was not as emotional and life felt more managable. I didnt even notice its effects while on it. I have tried other antidepressants that made me feel disconnected and my mind was cloudy, also experienced weight gain. Effexor did not make me feel like I was on anything, it just worked in the background. I only noticed it effects once I quit, my emotions were stronger and all my senses seemed intensified.
I was finally able to breathe, no dry feeling, no post nasal drip, I sing and it helped me tremendously
Prevented pregnancy, i did not experience any benifits whatsoever
The clots eventually completely dissolved over the course of the treatment.
I did not see a change in the condition of the toenail. Only about a quarter if the left great toenail was affected. After taking the drug for the 12 weeks, the physician recommended another 12 week course, however my insurance company would not cover the extended treatment and I could not afford the cost of Lamisil. Perhaps a positive effect would have been realized if I was able to continue the treatment
Using Vagifem for the first 18 months was brilliant. It increased lubrication and stopped the continual urethral soreness I had (and when passing water). It made everything feel normal again.
There weren't any.  I had to stop taking this medicine after 4 days due to the side effects.
Valtrex tablets work by stopping the multiplication of the virus which causes herpes. They can reduce the length and severity of an outbreak of herpes, the duration of pain and shorten the time to healing of crusts associated with herpes. Valtrex tablets help the blisters to heal more quickly. If you start


taking them as soon as you feel an outbreak starting, you may actually


prevent the blisters from developing.
the medicine was for contraceptive purposes, which it achieved. The medicine also regulated the periods and made them on a more regular basis. It also cleared my skin and helped with acne.
substantial reduction in joint pain caused from arthritis.
Patient complained of muscular pain in arm, thought to be broken. Visit to physician  proved otherwise. Arm imobilised and patent put on diclofenac. Thus far,no further complaint of pain, over past month increased mobility, and muscular strength.
The drug cleared my skin and even reduced some of the redness and scarring from the acne.  This was my first and last treatment.
Fast acting inhaler for asthma symptoms.
I think that the treatment might have improved my acne somewhat, but it always returned.  I stayed on this drug for several years, along with using topical medications.  I was using so many prescriptions that I don't really know which if any of them helped.  I always still had some acne during this treatment.
Helped with decreasing intermittent fluid retention in ankles and worked in conjunction with BP medication to decrease BP
The loss of bone mass retarded. It is difficult to measure the efficacy of the drug apart from a bone scan.  I do not nor have ever broken a bone. Considering my weakness in my wrists this drug may be credited with bone integrity.
Remarkable improvement in productivity (no down time) and feeling of well-being.
increased energy (moderate), weight stabilized
No pregnancy,no periods for 18 years, no menopause, estrogen production stopped, convenience
Cleared up my acne - worked very well. Skin was softer.
simptoms disappeared promptly.
the benefits aren't that great but i do get some kind of relief. i am in pain everyday all day.
I frequently experience heart palpitations at random times for random durations of time. Atenolol has help to suppress these palpitations, so I don't experience them as often. It has drastically reduced the number of episodes I have and also lessens the pounding feeling when the episodes do occur.
I have mild arthritis in my knees.  I play tennis 3-4 times a week and consistently experienced mild pain and swelling.  I just did not want to give up tennis so I played through the pain.  Within a week after taking Diclofenac, my knees felt like they did when I was 18!!!  It really was amazing and continues.  I litlerally have NO PAIN whatsoever in my knees...
The Ambien did give me a solid nights rest. I did not experience the rapid effect that I've often read about, i.e. that I would fall asleep within 20 minutes even if I was in the middle of an activity. It usually took about 40 minutes to take effect.
I quit smoking!!!! And so did my husband who was also taking it. I smoked about 1 pack a day and he smoked about 2 packs a day. Our lives have changed because of this drug and our children will be healthier too!
Prior to taking this medication, I was feeling very tired and "fuzzy headed".  I thought these feelings were just due to being overly busy and getting older.  In an annual check-up it was discovered that my thyroid levels were off.  This medication brought my thyroid level to normal. I noticed increased energy and mental clarity within just a few days of starting the medication.
Seemed to reduce some every-day pain and inflamation, although I still experienced increased pain and inflamation after physical therapy or increased activity.
I had cystic acne, however within the first month i the acne reduced significantly! By the time i was at the 6 month point i had no acne at all. The only down side were the side effects... i felt joint pain, extreme dryness- esp my lips, very dry eyes. I was uncomfortable, however i have been 1 1/2 year without it and i barely get a little zit anymore.
I had acne constantly and would break out a few time a week.  My breakouts have gotten better and only occur occaisionally.
My pain would subside for several hours. The drug gave me a sense of Euphora which allowed me to deal with the pain better. It gave me a comforting sensation and allowed me to sleep good. My mood changed for the better, almost as if I were high.It actually motivated me to do the things i would normally be too lazy to do. This medication put me in a good mood and a carefree mood.
The Soma made the patient agitated and did not work. The Flexril made the patient relax and sleep enough to let the rib heal nicely.
It helped cure the acne all over the bodyhhhhhhhhhh
There were absolutely NO treatment benefits. I felt worse while on this drug than before I started taking it.
Mild suppression of the infection, slightly reduced upper respitory tract symptoms, some reduced coughing, some reduced mucus production. The symptoms took at least 5 out of the seven days to begin to dissipate, which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as Maxamox. Unfortunately the side effects were more noticeable than the treatment benefits, and the prescribing doctor mistook the side effects for another symptom that was not actually present.
Did not take it long enough to evaluate the benefits.
lower blood pressure
Anxiety since childhood was relieved.  Felt free to enjoy life and explore opportunities that once would have been declined due to over anxiety and fear of failure or rejection. Have a much more stable emotional balance.
my acne calmed down by 75%.still had some break outs when not used on time,but still nothing else would stop the break outs.everything I used just made it worse and mt skin was very dry and inflamed.those problems went away.my skin isn't dry it is back to normal even in the winter when its dry out.
During the 4 years so far [out of 5], I have had no recurrance of the tumour and no additional tumours have been detected by ultra-sound, mammogram, and twice-yearly check-ups. Perhaps the greatest benefit is the gradual reduction in stress experienced as a result of my on-going stabilised condition after a lumpectomy.
stopped hot flashes
cleared up acne with first treatment.
going from at least 5 full days of migraine a week i managed 16 whole days without one. then when i did have one it was for 6 straight days and the migraines have been back to as they were before. brief relief was seriously chuffed, now gutted, maybe dosage increase may help???

I was 6 days into having my very first cold sore which had since turned into TWO on the left and right sides of my bottom lip and I had already tried abreva and campho-phenique with absolutely no benefit. I thought I was going to suffer for weeks. It was so painful and kept scabbing then the scabs would fall off after drinking or taking a shower. Then I saw my dr who prescribed Zovirax ointment. I swear, the NEXT day, both cold sores were half the size and no longer "weeping". It is just about healed. This stuff works and now that I know I get cold sores, I will never be without Zovirax. Ever.
The Medformin controls my blood sugar. I've been taking it for eight years now with no side effects. I continue to enjoy the food I eat without worry because I regularly take this medicine. It does not contradict with the medicine I take for my hyperthyroidism. Medformin is also affordable that's why I can regularly take this medicine.
The medicine was taken to prevent infection since a hole was drilled to drain the gathered blood and release pressure on my nail bed.  As a result, I am in the process of regrowing a healthy nail.
Reduced redness of the forhead and cheeks.
Lowering blood pressure
The first time I used the drug it lightened the patches of melasma. The second time I used it, about a year later, it actually darkened them. I was told that happens to some people who use hydroquinone and that I will never be able to use it. I use sun block every day, year round.





I am Irish-Italian-German-Dutch. My skin is fair yet any trauma results in hyperpigmentation.
completely changed my way of life...  within days, could tell a difference... no longer suffer from night sweats or hot flashes at all,  the best thing i have ever tried..  this is a topical lotion that comes in individual packets that are 1.74 grams each (daily dosage is  2 packets)

The topamax helped reduce the frequency of the migraines significantly.  In addition, it also helped me to loose weight at the beginning of the treatment.
ALLOWED ME TO QUIT SMOKING WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL WITHDRAWL
I took my puppy to the vet. The puppy was having diarrhea and vomiting. The vet gave him metoclopramide (perinorm) for vomiting and Metronidazole for diarrhea. 


Within 2 days the puppy died. He was so weak after metronidazole that he could not move . He was quiet ok before I took him to vet.
I suffered from anxiety for years. My GP prescribed me the Citalopram after I got unfairly dismissed from my job. I didn't feel any difference for 2-3 weeks, then I felt great. I have been enjoying every second of my life since taking this drug.
After a couple weeks, my hair grew stronger, hairs that were lost along the hairline grew back.  This product really does work
the frown lines on the forehead were diminished for a period of abut 3 months
Zyrtec D helped me live almost symptom free every day. Only during the fall when the ragweed count was exceptionally high (my worst allergy by far), did I feel some mild symptoms of allergies. No other medication has so effectively eliminated my symptoms on a consistent basis.
Was able to fall asleep within 30 minutes of taking Lunesta.  Stayed asleep for at least 4 hours to 10 hours.
Moderately helped control my asthma and COPD.
Benefits were milder and less frequent seizures.
It relieved my respiratory infection along with my cold and cough.

Blackheads are gone. Pores on my cheeks are noticeably smaller. Acne scars faded. Skin looks more polished.
The treatment benefits of QVAR are that I do not think about my condition. Also, it is easy to execute the treatment.  I exercise and go about my day as if I were not afflicted with asthma.  I do not worry about having an attack, which is a big relief.  The treatment is inconspicuous, another plus.
Quick and lasting relief of back and neck pain and muscle spasms. The effects are felt after about 1 hour, and full effects are felt after 1 1/2 hours, and about 80% of the pain and tension are relieved for about 4-6 hours. If stretching of the muscles is done while on the medicine, the pain and tension are greatly reduced for longer than the 4-6 hours. If the medicine is taken before bed, morning pain and tension are reduced about 50%.
Immediate relief of hot flashes (from 10-12 per day to 2-4 per week),sleep disruption, moodiness/agitation, depression (or periodic unexplained "dark days"), lack of libido.
I've not got any benefits. I've just spoiled my skin and pigment spots look now dark brown and they are very obvious.
My cough was reduced, from 24 hours a day, to a few episodes per day
Extremely effective appetite suppresant. Provides long-term energy and appetitie control throughout the day. Helps patient easily lose weight.
I am so thankful for Imetrex. I have severe migraine headaches at leat 2 to 3 times a month. Before taking Imetrex my headaches would last 3 to 4 days. With Imetrex I can take the pill and my headache is gone within the hour. I have no side effects from the taking this medicine.
Night sweats greatly reduced within a week, from 3-5 strong episodes a night (and associated sleep disturbance) to 0-1 a night (mostly in the early a.m.) and less severe and shorter duration.
I was able to focus and get things done.  I wasn't overwhelmed with the amount of things I had to do and didn't get discouraged as easily as usual.
Within the first eight months I did not notice any benefits and decided to stop the treatments. Once off the Prozac my depression was worsen made me realise that the treatment was working but that I had not realised this.I restarted my treatment shortly after and felt much better. Although I felt better I realised that Prozac by itself was not the answer and I had to address other areas in my life.
none tho my doctor told me that it would lower my cholesterol if I took it and ate less red meat and more fish. But I don't like fish and love red meat so just eat low fat meat now like chicken.
The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously, I had felt "paralyzed," or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it, I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house, and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said, it worked the first day, but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.).
prevention of recurrence of estrogen positive tumours
protection against pregnancy.
blood pressure came to with in normal limits, overall feeling of well-being and reduced risk of longterm cardiovascular copmlications
the medicine in the beginning provided about 30% relief in pain, but as time progressed it only provided about 10% pain relief. This being said, it does provide some mental relief from chronic pain. and it relieves some of the muscle stiffness.
pain relief from arthritis flare up, no stomach or other side effects.


The medication needed to be taken with food or milk to avoid stomach upset.
I had gotten severe age spots on my hands, probably from spending many years driving long distances each day.  My hands looked worse than anyone else's my age (or older!).  My hands now looks pretty good/very good!
none
Benefits were to treat insomnia.
some decreased depression but not as well as with wellbutrin
The drug rapidly gets rid of migraine.
I began suffering from "heartburn" in my late thirties. This condition progressed to a daily occurence. Not willing to avoid spicey foods my physician prescribed ranitidine. I recall he intially prescribed 150mg twice daily. At one point he recommended 300mg twice aday. But 150mg twice daily is working. The dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero.
I had suffered from daily acid reflux for approximately 4 or 5 months. Sometimes the reflux was so severe that I could not sleep. I changed my diet and tried many drugs, including ranitidine, Prilosec and Pepcid AC--none of whic helped. Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation, for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment, my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet.
Eradicated the infection.
I was able to fall asleep and stay asleep.
Fell asleep easily without feeling drugged the next day.
reduced or eliminated adult acne on face, chest, and back
My whole lip used to swell up and I would get over a dozen little pockets of fluid that would merge into one giant blister. Now, cold sores appear 1/2 as often as before - down to every other month at most. One or two little pockets of fluid usually appear without the unsightly swelling. The cold sore is dried up within 24 hrs. They became unnoticeable to everyone.
Mood lifted considerably. Able to live life again. Life is much lighter. I am no longer oversensitive, things like life's little injustices don't hurt so much anymore. My daily experiences in this initial period can be followed on: http://nortriptyline.blogspot.com/ where I am keeping a diary. This is for the benefit of others who are indecisive and want to know more details before embarking on a course of medication themselves with nortriptyline.
Hard, sustained erections. Penetration is not a problem and there's no longer any concern about losing an erection too soon.  Lasting longer seems to result in more intense orgasms.
Helped ease constipation without causing discomfort. I have tried many different types of laxatives, fibers, etc to help reduce my problems with constipation. Many laxatives cause extreme cramping and work only the one time. The next day, the problem returns. With Miralax, I took it for the three consecutive days and it worked slowly, but without cramping, and without and discomfort at all. The effects lasted for several weeks -- that is, I had a bowel movement every day, easily. After about three weeks I needed to take it again, but it was only for the three days and then it had the same effect. I have been doing this now for almost a year. I feel significantly better.
We tried various allergy medicines including zyrtec, but my son continued to have re-occurring sinuses infections and chronic nasal congestion.  Then we tried clarinex.  This past winter, we were sinuses infection free. The clarinex also cleared up the chronic nasal congestion.  It also helps that he likes the taste of the medicine.
Treatment quickly eliminated discomfort associated with the sinus infection.  These included ear ache, sore throat, and fever.  These symptoms were partially alleviated within 24 hours of the first dose.  Within 48 hours, all symptoms were no longer present.  However, the eliminated symptoms associated with the sinus infection were almost immediately replaced by negative side effects.
I no longer felt depressed. I felt back to "my old self" and able to function normally in everyday activities.
I made a good recovery from a moderate depressive illness and I believe that maintenance therapy has prevented me from relapsing especially when i have been under additional stress .I only have to take it once per day. I have only had one increase in dosage from 75mg to 150 mg
ability to sleep at night and through the night was substantially increased
Patient reported fewer mood swings, with very few side effects. Less affective toward depression, but she was able to reduce the amount of lithium, which caused extensive side-effects. This medication was implemented as part of her regular treatment plan.
enalapril was suitable for me as it was effective at lowering my b/p. also of all the medication i had been treated with enalapril was the most suitable.
Lost 52 pounds with the meds and a diet program.  Was able to reduce the amount of dose on the diabetic meds.
I was able to take a full breath without wheezing and it seemed to reduce the mucous and inflammation in my lungs temporarily.
chlamydia cleared after the 7day treatment.acne cleared which was a plus but came bk once treatment stopped. not many benfits cause i suffered so much with side effects and didnt take any other medication cause didnt know what i could take.
The biggest benefit was when I quit smoking, because I had been taking it for a while...it proved to assist with the cravings...it's probably why I was able to quit in the first place.
The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a "zombie" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants.
It is very effective, especially if you take it early enough. But even if you wait till the cold sore is larger, it still stops the growth of cold sores completely, and helps to heal pretty quick. id say within 2-3 days. Its so worth it if you are like me, and get cold sores ALLLLL the time. (at LEAST 10 times a year, no joke) I have to have the medicine with me at all times. The sad thing is, I'm only allowed 4 refills a year, so I have to lower my dosage, but, it still works.
Regained hair growth. Minoxidil first increased hairloss (normal during the first weeks of using). New hair started to grow after around seven months. I have now regained my normal hairgrowth. The hairs itself have a slightly larger diameter and are bit more curled.
Reduction in fine wrinkles
No treatment benefits. the edema was so severe that the abdominal wall was pushed out, causing the genitofemoral nerve to pull even more, so pain was increased.
Smooth, clear skin.  The Roaccutane not only got rid of my acne but also rejuvenated my skin.  Pores were finer, blackheads were gone.
The acne cleared up but the evoclin was used in combination with proactiv.  Proactiv was used before and then started getting acne again. Then I was given evoclin and used both and the acne cleared up and the whiteheads and blackheads disappeared.  there was also a increase in the softness and suppleness of the facial skin.
The benefits were clearer skin with more radiance,skin didn't seem so dull, but some discomfort througout the process.
acid reflux was reduced
lessening of pain, some increase in mobility - took abt 7 mos. to see improvement
Breast cancer was oestrogen and progesterone positive so taking this following surgery and radiotherapy reduced likelihood of recurrence
Acne cleared up remarkably, pretty much disappeared altogether.
After 20 years of visiting dermatologists and trying every topical and oral treatment available accutane is the only medication that COMPLETELY cured my acne, improved skin texture, pore size, and minimized the mild pits/scarring I had.  It has been 10 years and my acne never returned.
After 2 years of treating hypothydoidism with 100 mgr dose, the patient was able to lower the dose to 88 mgr per day. Thyroid levels are now normal.
Very effective in obtaining a mild peel, to slough off dead skin cells, every 15 days or so.
I did not find any benefit really.  In fact it seemed to make me more anxious.
AT FIRST IT KEPT MY SYMPTONS TO A MINIMUM, AND MOOD IN GENERAL INHANCED. THIS FOR ALMOST A FULL YEAR....THEN I NEEDED TO UP DOSAGE FIRST WENT TO 6 WEEKS...THEN TO EVERY 4WEEKS...DOSE INCREASED TO MAX OF 10MG
After a copule of days I started to feel a little better. I did not feel as much tension in my stomach, and the pain started to go away. I have been using it everytime I feel pain in my stomach. I did not have heart burn though. It was only treated for pain/ulcer purposes.
Ostensibly this product will prevent further hair loss. While the initial male pattern baldness is mild, I fear worsening of the condition, and am taking this as a preventive measure.
this drug kept my sugar down constantly to where it should be finally.i am very satisfied with it so far.
The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's "Bluff Dust" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience.
My skin became infected from scratching too much and too hard when I had an allergic reaction to a topical skin product.  A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.  I was prescribed zyrtec in conjunction with the antibiotic but it causes severe drowsiness.  My doctor had me discontinue the zyrtec and see how I did with the cephalexin alone.  I continued to heal faster than I think I would have without the medication.
I WAS LIVING WITH PAIN IN MOST OF THE MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS OF MY BODY.  IT HAD GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF HAVING TO HAVE HELP TO GET OUT OF BED.  WHEN THERE WAS A FLARE-UP I HAD TO GO TO BED. TRAMADOL HCL COMBINED WITH CYMBALATA REDUCED MY PAIN BY ABOUT 85%!  MADE MY LIFE LIVABLE AGAIN.  I'M THANKFUL THAT I HUNG IN THROUGH THE SIDE EFFECTS OF CYMBALATA.  IT TOOK OVER A YEAR TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF DRUGS AND I'M THANKFUL THAT FINALLY DID.
There was little to no benefit from taking the medication. Acne did not visibly improve over the entire course of medication.
improved breathing, less frequent asthma attacks and the ability to run either outside or inside, depending on the season
Hypothyroidism was already causing me to gain weight, this garbage accelerated the weight gain.  I eat one fish fillet or chicken breast/day, nothing else, now gaining 3-6 lbs./month!  Since I can't find a Dr. who will treat my T3 I'm ordering Cytomel online, from what I've read it's the ticket to eliminate hypo symptoms.  Shame on physicians who treat lab results rather than the patient.  I don't care what the numbers are, I still feel awful!
I have tried various alternatives to penicillin and this has been the best. I had a nasty cat bite (a tooth stuck in my bone, so it was deep). I was told I was highly likely to get a a deep and painful infection given the depth of the bite. So I was warned to take all of these or I'd be back later for IV treatment and it would be a far longer course. Well, I took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did I never get an infection, I had few side effects. There was, perhaps, a slight stomach upset but not even enough to need what I standardly use -- yogurt. I'd recommend this to those who need a penicillin replacement.
The treatment benefits were smoking cessation, first a gradual reduction 2-10 a day then 1-2 a day  then I quit for 2 weeks
--reduced redness on face [especially around nose and cheek areas]


--helps reduce time that an open sore heals on face.


--overall - I am satisfied with Metrogel's performance concering Roseasa.
Helped reduce some of the anxiety and had a moderate effect on the depression although it did not go away.
significant reduction in cholesterol levels
There were no benefits as he had to stop taking it
Immediate relielf from anxiety.....even better after a couple of weeks.  May focus is better on this drug than all the years (about 15) I have been treated for ADD.
I guess they helped me through a really challenging time in my life where i was not coping, and wanted to die. i was severely depressed, and needed to have meds to help me stay focussed
I woke up with a more relaxed jaw. I have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism.
My blood pressure was out of control. My doctors had prescribed diuretics (limited effectiveness) and other forms of calcium channel blockers. This in my opinion is a wonder drug!My blood pressure had shot up so badly that I would get nosebleeds when working on my knees or bending over.My pressure was in the triple digits at times.
Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over.
fell asleep fast, woke up withouut significant fatique. Mild grogginess for a short time subsided within one hour of waking.
Improved sleep considerably, relieved muscle pain, calmed anxiety, stabilized mood swings.
slight reduction but that is all, 2nd week always still there so yet again more pills but usually never completely gone. accupuncture far more effective, within a few weeks gone down, consider that lymph was size of a walnut so that is great news
The Differin resulted in decreased body acne on the face and back.  i also felt smoother, cleaner skin
Treatment of skin infection.
My skin cleared of acne after two weeks, I still have oily skin 


I use bare mineral makeup to minimize oil 


overall my skin look great.
As a former drug addict, I flat refused anything that would be addictive. ie diazepam, tamazepam, etc. My doctor suggested buspar as it was not addictive, and yet had similar effects to diazepam. He prescribed it on a prn basis, and i was sceptical. However, within 20 minutes of taking it, the effects were astounding. Anxiety subsided, and a feeling of warmness enveloped me. One dose lasted about 5 hours, and did not inhibit any other aspect of my day to day activites. It also helped with my disrupted sleep patterns.
yes - increased bone mass 4% over 2 years. sonagram taken twice in two years this is a very effective drug and i was happy with this experience
i had very less cravings, still at this poilnt still want to smoke evry now and again, but its early yet.
It helped relieve anxiety because it made me sleep.  I found that prior to taking this medication, I could not sleep and that I was not eating properly.  My overall health was suffering.
got rid of fine lines around my eyes. It also improved my overall complexion. Minimized line between my eyebrows.
I believe the treatment at the lower 10 mg dose was effective in reducing the serverity of my brain lesions. I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors.
As a caregiver, I did not see any benefits, the patient continued to have problems with insomnia
There were no known benefits. I truly believed that the doctor that prescribed me this stupid medication should rot in hell. There are too many side effects, especially long term ones. 





The worst part is, they did not even tell me how and why their diagnosis was accurate. they just prescribe drugs left and right as if they had no conscience or they are evil people just out for the money.
I started to feel better within a few weeks, the side effects were very mild, MAJOR WEIGHT LOSS, ABOUT 10LBS, I have energy I never had before. My anxiety no longer exsists.
increased concentration, additional energy, able to complete projects, more patient with my children and now volunteer in my spare time helping children.
The nexium provided two benefits.  First, it completely stopped the constant heartburn.  I have not had one second of heart burn since I started taking the drug.  Second, it healed the Barret's esophagus completely.  This has been verified by my GI doctor via two upper endoscopies and biopsies.  Nexium is a miracle drug.
I didn't find it had any.
The acne cleared up for a while but soon after discontinuing use it would return.  It reduced breakouts significantly.
When I started taking this medication I was first put on 150mgs twice a day. After about 6 months felt that it was not really working. After Dr upped dosage to 450 mgs per day i have never felt better. Use to be extremely emotional, weepy, and just did not want to get out of bed. It has helped with my symptoms from the fibromyalgia, and my anxiety. It has also helped me drop weight which is a bonus too.
I took lyrica for fibromyalgia and it relieved my symptoms within one week.  I felt significantly better quite quickly, even after I had tried extensive physical therapy for my symptoms.
The pain subsided very quickly with no side effects.
I was much more awake in the mornings instead of groggy and foggy -brained. I was able to focus a LITTLE bit better
I had fewer swings in my mood. I felt down less often. My anxiety level was much lower.
Immediately after a complete hysterectomy, menopause set in.  Night sweats and insomnia were making life difficult.  Immediately after starting the Climara patch, all menopausal symptoms were relieved.
Non moody after taking 1/3 of 1 pill, calm and relaxed.
Ability to sleep 8 full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic.
better T scores after 2 years
When the antidepressant finally kicked in (after about two weeks), I finally felt "normal."  It made me realize how down I was.  I've heard other people say the same thing about feeling "normal."  I would still get down but it wouldn't last for days.  I could get through it like a healthy-minded person.  It was such a relief from what I had been feeling.  I told myself that I would take it forever if I had to......anything to not feel what I had been feeling for years:  depressed that I'm not good enough.
The prescription was given for anxiety and to help with sleep during long flights and when under high anxiety situations. Lorazepam helped to calm and induced drowziness. I would not recomend this if you have to stay alert as it can make functioning dificult.
Stop the pain
Actually the Amitriptyline greatly helped with getting to sleep each night as an added benefit. It is an antidepressant but used in this case to break a cycle of tension headaches. The pattern of tension headaches was broken and the headaches have not since returned. It also acted as a migraine headache preventative.
no hot flashes, increased libido, increased energy level, seemed to feel more zestful.  prilosec controlled acid reflux well
improved texture, reduced comedones a little on some parts of face, yet produced a flare up of acne on forehead and chin. since other users had similar reaction at the initial 6 -10 weekss of usage, i am waitng for this unpleasant effect to wear off.
It releived symptoms of crohns disease and inflammatory bowel disease. It stopped symptoms of bloating pain cramping and diarrea associated with crohns disease. I did not have any side effects from this medication. After surgery I began taking this medication daily at first I took 16 capsules a day 4 ccapsules 4 timea a day. Then cut it back to 8 daily. About 2 years ago I began taking the 500 mg dosage and take this 2 capsules 2 times a day.
I took this drug for pain relief due to surgery (laproscopically assisted hysterectomy). Although the pain I experienced wasn't great the drug did relieve it but the side effects were not worth it.
cleared my UI i didnt even know i had one..
Moderate reduction in alergy symptoms
Prevented pregnancy & acne
Not many. But it helped numb the pain and slightly make the redness fade away. It also helped me get to sleep and keep a scheduele.
Somewhat reduced the shoulder pain. My should still hurt when I moved my arm certain ways but it was somewhat lessened.
Did stop the sniffles and clear the nasal passages.  Headaches were still a problem.  However, coupling this product with aspirin provided a good solution.
My Facial skin turger increased slightly and became brighter (not red) and more vibrant....was less dull in appearance.  It also seemed to even out my skin tone.
The benefits of this treatment were as I had hoped. I had developed some facial hair over the past few years and grew tired of tweezing and waxing. The treatment took a few months to work, but over time has minimized the hair growth. I will continue to use this as it is a very simple once a day application.
Taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in "safe" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life.
Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks


without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans


to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to


live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some


prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered


headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide


open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil


and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management


physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days


without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked


forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have


probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When


I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without


additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from


Elavil.  Thank you Elavil.
I found metro gel to be irritating and drying. My face seemed more red than before I started taking it. It was actually uncomfortable from dryness. I did not want to use the cream because it seemed to be heavy, possibly leading to breakouts. My doctor then gave me a presciption for noritate, which did not have the side effects I mentioned above. Plus, you only have to use it once per day, which I like alot.
Has successfully lowered and maintained patient's cholesterol levels for over nine years. Follow-up with 6 month bloodwork shows the liver to be stable - no evidents deleterious effects on the liver.
The product helped skin to look healthy, helped a small amount to reduce pigmentation and wrinkling.  The product helped to maintain the skin at it's current level with some improvement in look.  The 60 gm tube lasted almost a year and so it was an affordable treatment for the skin.
none
Following a severe and prolonged attack of pancreatitis (primarily due to alcohol) and a 2 month hospitalization, surgery to treat pancreatic cysts was required.  After release from the hospital, a persistent abdominal pain was experienced.  Normal N-SAID pain relievers were not used because of stomach irritation and I am unresponsive to acetaminophen.  Oxycodone twice per day relieved all pain and allows me to live and work productively pain-free.
Hormone replacement therapy is used to control menopause symptoms - I need to take prometrium with estrogen to prevent uterine cancer. I sleep well. I do not have night sweats. I do not have mood swings. My skin is not dry. I do not experience vaginal dryness.
It helps with sneezing but my nose runs like a faucet. It relieves my itching eyes, I don't cough as much.
Drastic reduction of sinus infections, from 3-4 per year down to 1 or less. My 23 year old daughter takes it with the same results.
The Femring is great because you insert it and don't have to worry about remembering to take a pill or pills every day. This allows you freedom for the next three months, (90) days until your reorder a new ring.  Also my insurance pays a good portion of the cost of the ring, whereas it did not cover the cost of bio-identical horomone treatments.
This medication did not make me sedated or cause constipation like the last one I tried and I had no trouble getting to sleep at night.
The treatment definitely increased productivity for me during the day when before I had experienced far too much fatigue to work effectively or focus
The application of estrace relieved vaginal dryness virtually overnight. It also caused reduction of pain during intercourse. Improved sex drive and response.
Only real success of the treatment has been that I stopped "zoning" out into a semi-conscious state.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE results relating to depression, weight gain, pain in joints & muscles, and fatigue.
Better heart condition, stronger bones taken along with my calcium
I was more alert during the day.
Helped with acne but long term use darker her teeth due to sunlight exposure and a reaction with the doxycycline and the tertiary enamel still being laid down inside the tooth.  Long term I gestation of this drug combined with sunlight exposure might darken teeth over years
Drastically reduced the amount of time the cold sores were present on the side of face.   Medication also made the cold sore break out less servere.
I didn't notice any benefit at all. Supposedly, it was to help keep my mood balanced.  More than anything, I was focused on the very apparent and prevalent side effects.
I only have mild acne, but it was immediately cleared up within a few days of taking Oracea.
Pain relief allowing uninterupted sleep.
The medicine gave me that added energy to feel good during the day and to have the engergy to keep up with me 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. It didn't make me jittery. It just boosted my energy. It did give me considerable dry mouth. I did notice that I would be a little more tired if I didn't take it for a couple of days. I think it is mildly addictive. Overall, I gained more benefit from it than negatives. I did worry about blood pressure because it did seem to increase my heartrate. I would recommend it to those who suffer from mild depression and/or just need a little extra energy boost. The medication is actually to treat narcolepsy, a condition in which a patient falls asleep at random times and has trouble staying awake.
The major benefits of taking the prescribed dose of effexor was rapid relief and abaitment of my core and chronic anxiety and secondary depression. It was very severe and I had tried many other psychotropic meds on the market without success.
excruciating ear pain began to improve within minutes of taking the first pill.  ear pain continued to diminish and was eliminated by day 4.
I've been on meds for depression/anxiety for over 20 years and have tried many medications and combinations. Nothing has ever effectively controlled my depression but Lamictal seems to have stabilized my condition at a tolerable level. I am more mentally "resilient".....I don't stay down too long; I'm able to bounce back quickly from a depressive state. I'm also taking Mirtazapine (30mg; 2 a day). Maybe it's the combination that helps. I was recently taking Pristiq and Mirtazapine and was terribly depressed. I quit taking the Pristiq and began Lamictal and had and a very quick improvement.
complete suppression of heartburn
The benefits of the treatment are clearer, eventoned facial skin.  Much firmer and healthier looking skin.
As for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome patient, the main goal of the treatment was to regulate ovulation, and to regulate menstrual period. After 4 months of treatment (only 2 months therapeutic dose), I become pregnant and now have a beautiful son.
Cleared up most of the symptoms for the 10 day period for both periods on it.





Both terms that i took the drug, the symptoms returned 2 days later with very intense pain then weakened over the next week... still sick now for the 7th straight
Much more focused when taking medication. Able to complete a task before starting another one.  More attentive to what is happening/being said around me. Less impulsive (e.g., when not taking, will start singing or behaving silly at inappropriate times)
The treatment benefits were a noticable reduction in nasal symptoms of runny nose and itching. Additionally, I had no nasal pressure or headaches due to same. The drug needs to be taken daily. I would take it for a month at a time. It started working within two days after noticing my allergy symptoms flaring up (When Christmas tree came into house and in spring when trees pollinate.)
Decrease in rhytids. Reduction in blackheads, congestion.
I first started taking Tramadol when a doctor prescribed it for some back pain I had been experiencing.  But then I continued to take it because it really relieved my depression.  It is a great mood enhancer and I have had a lot more energy and enthusiasm since taking it.
I feel much better and this is only the second day on the medication. When the Prednisone is in my system it feels like I am almost completely better. Once it wears off (before my next day) I am still sick but better than the day before.
Throat infection cleared up by the 2nd day of treatment.
After adjusting to the medication, focus and alertness improved significantly.  Fatigue and trouble "becoming bored" disappeared and I was ablve to focus on school studies and work for the first time in many many years.  No stimulant effect was felt, but it even became fun to actually sit down on a couch and just read a book.
no benefit still tired short of breath losing hair can't lose weigth loss of libido
I'm  taking better care of myself and my appearance. I'm interacting with people and don't feel so detached from others. I'm starting to look forward to things again after feeling numb for so long.


Minimal side effects and only lasted a few days. I couldn't tolerate any other anti-D's that I tried because of side effects.
Alleviation of symptoms associated with hypothyroidism: weight gain, hair loss, fatigue, and so on.  Further, medication was taken during pregnancy with no apparent ill effects to the fetus, and with the benefit of carrying to term with none of the adverse effects associated with hypothyroidism and pregnancy.
Cleared up the UTI quickly and completely with no side effects
I had increased focus the first day, and after a short trial of ritalin IR I appreciated the consistancy of the vyvanse, the medication didn't give me the same up and down emotionally (which is great when you are trying to lead a family) but i did give up some of the motivation that accompanied ritalin, I was hoping for the 12hr coverage but have settled into a routine,  of dose of 70mg at 7 feeling affects about 40 min later and then feeling foggy at 2.
Acid indigestion daily not impacted by over-the-counter medications. Used as prescribed, majority of acid indigestion is gone.
we had to go back to the doctor and my son finally got diagnosed with pneumonia and was hospitalized immediately
the benefits of the treatment were that the blood sugar level that were very high in the beginning of the treatment went to controlled level. (it is controlled with the use of the medicine. I do not know what happens if I stop taking the medicine.)taking the medicine also helps in controlling hunger and so it help in having three meals, on regular times.
Made skin moderately better for a few months
None
To reduce high blood pressure. To reduce pain and inflammation of Rheumatoid Arthritis
it alleviated my severe depression related to an extended period of high stress events in my life.  The depression was debilitating.
Acne cleared up. Lines, wrinkles disappeared. Generally I looked/look 15 years younger!
I WAS ABLE TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. TACHYCARDIA DISAPPEARED.  ANXIETY AND ALL OTHER SYMPTOMS RELATED TO DEPRESSION WERE UNDER CONTROL.
Initially weightloss of 4 stone and an increase in energy and confidence. After stopping the drug there was a gradual weight gain of 10lbs until weight settled and has been maintained for 3 years. Health has improved and an increase in fitness and regular exercise has been maintained.Benefits have outwayed the side effects as all other attempts over the years to lose weight had failed, and there is a family history of heart disease.
Seemed to take effect after the first dose. I noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. I was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. I was having all kinds of muscle twitches so I went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels. I am a mother and a wife and I was reluctant to take anything to help with my situation but am now glad I did.. I am only a week into it so I guess time will tell. But so far I am happy with the results.
While on the drug, I experienced some level of mood stabilization, marked by a greater ability to 'flow with' daily stress.
Eliminated nicotine cravings and made smoking cessation very easy.
helped to stay awake, without the side effects that I had when I used to take dexedrine, like jittery, agitation, dry mouth
I have a great reduction in stomach acid problems. When I've tried to use natural products like Alo Vera juice or licorice-based products, to take care of the problem, it is very difficult, and I have to take products throughout the day to have any success whatsoever. So taking one pill first thing in the morning holds me most of the day, though I often begin to get some acid in the evening.
decrease in depression and suicidal thoughts. Gives more energy to be productive in life. Feel more positive and less inclined to take naps during the day to escape from depression.
I started noticing changes on my back
I grew about half my hair back on top of my head.
Really cut down the tooth infection/pain and swollen glands, during the first course of treatment I did not have any side effects at all.
reduction in severity and duration of migraines
Decreased symptoms
I was perscribed this after I decided to quite narcotic pain killers.  I was taking fairly large doses of Oxycotin and switched to Voltaren 75mg.  They will not touch my pain.  I guess I have a high tolerance for pain meds.  I don't believe they would be effective for people with chronic moderate to severe pain.
being able to sleep/decrease anxiety surrounding  getting to sleep and staying asleep. Also taken during times of high anxiety. Helped to control anger outbursts and uncontrolled anxiety.
I had been on many different treatments for depression throughout most of my adult life and the side effects seamed to outweigh the benefits.  Since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned, my ambition and motivation returned.  On my last medication I was going to sleep at 8 p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now I sleep 7-8 hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.  I had a 5 lb weight loss in the beginning that I have maintained.  Over all I feel I am managing my depression better than I have at any time in the past.
Reduced pain in legs and forearms, and blocked the pain from the arthritis in my lower back.  The pain in my legs from the RLS is considerably lessoned.  I also was in chronic pain from my arthritis, but can now move around without any pain, (unless I lift or do any type of work that is strenuous), but I used to be in so much pain that I would cry, so it was definitely worth it for me to take Neurontin.
Very easy birth control method. You don't have to worry about taking a pill every day. Day to day I can't feel it at all and my husband can't either. Stays in place.
Fast- acting, works in 15-20 mins.
Treatment benefits were to address pain and discomfort.  It was perscribed to me after I was in the hospital instead of Vicaden (spelling?), as Vicaden does not suite me well.  The medication began working after about 45 minutes of taking it and (for me) lasted over 6 hours.
able to sleep through the night
Controlled itching in eyes, nasal and chest congestion, and "tickle cough" very well
lifted depression, calmed violent mood swings
I have severe pain in my lower abdomin that was so strong I couldn't sleep nor move around very well. Luckily I sit mostly at work so I was able to deal with a little while, but eventually I went to the ER and they prescribed me this. Which I have never heard or taken before.
Paxil quickly improved my depression and also helped with mild anxiety issues I was experiencing.  I was very pleased with the speed with which my depression improved.  Within four weeks I was feeling better than I had felt in a very long time.  I have been on it for two months and am still improving.
While taking Zyprexa, I never experienced any episodes of hypomania (low mania) which typically accompany Bipolar Type II; however, I attribute this mostly to the fact that Zyprexa is very sedating. It should be noted that although Zyprexa is classified as an A-typical antipsychotic, it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with Bipolar Disorder.
Possible slight improvements in texture.
Considerable less craving for alcohol
focus is better during school. he is able to take test better. weekends and summer breaks are great while the pill is working.
Frova eliminated Migraine Headaches and the effect would last 24 hours.
stopped sweating, but the drying effect brought a very dry mouth and throat as well as side effect
I experienced less depression, increased libido plus the added benefit of decreased desire for cigarettes.
Slowed heart rate, lowered blood pressure and helped eliminate head-aches that I atributed to increasing BP.
Stopped bleeding and relieved some abdominal cramps.
Trazodone allows me to fall asleep within ten minutes and sleep through the night, awaking in the morning without grogginess.
I had tried EVERY over the counter product for acid reflux and none of them worked. I also have tried other prescriptions for acid reflux and none have worked for me as well as Prevacid has.
The patient's was able to see positive effects in 2 weeks time.  She noted an improvement in mood, spouse noted a reduction in symptoms relating to prementrual syndrome, and a return of normal sleep patterns.  Overall return of positive mood and enjoyment of previous activities.
Taking Tramadol has resulted in the effective management of chronic pain due to severe TMJ.
The drug caused the depression to recede to the point that I was able to function normally. The libido lowering effects of a prior antidepressent (SSRI) were alleviated completely. I was able to lose excess weight gained during treatment with the other SSRI
Decongestion, elimination of sinus pressure and tearing of eyes
Mild lightening of age and sun spots.
Weight loss of over 10 pounds in 4 months, continuing weight loss at a gradual rate (need to lose 40 pounds total).  Complete curbing of sugar and carbohydrate cravings, increased appetite control, cessation of binge eating patterns.
The treatment benefits were that the cephalexin relieved the sinus infection around the 4th day and by the seventh day my sinuses felt better. The cephalexin seemed relatively mild as I did not experience any intestinal discomfort, bloating or cramping that I have experienced with other antibiotics.
This spray clears the nasal passages to promote free breathing. I've tried over the counter remedies but they are harsh and you end up practically addicted to them. This works much the same way but is non-addictive and need only be used when symptoms hit. I have used this same product when I've had a head cold and achieved the same results. I'm pretty sure that's not what it's intended for but whenever I've got sinus pressure, I take this product.
my blood pressure stayed in the normal range. the headaches I was having from hypertension subsided.
very quick sleep induction within 30 minutes, frequently even faster.  No grogginess in the morning, felt very refreshed.  I also took the medicine to aid in jet lag and during long flights.
Within 1/1-/2 months I am now starting on 2 pills at night which is 3 mg. 


The pain that I normally get in my chest (from my Crohn's) is gone. 


I feel better and I am not as tired. It is a wonder drug and I wish they would run more trials so more people can gain the benefits of this drug. Other drugs started out this way and were tested off label for other diseases, why not LDN.
Lowered blood pressure
Prevented a recurrence of the leg and lung clots during the period of therapy and helped the body stabilize long enough to repair and/or work around the damaged areas, eventually resulting in elimination of pain and swelling.
I suffered swollen and extremely sore throats with lots of mucus gathering up at the back of my throat. Because of this, I ended up having my tonsils and adenoids removed separately but this did not help at all. I also relieved several treatments for antibiotics but this was wasted as all they did was lowered my immune system. After being diagnosed with an airborne allergy, I took one tablet daily, they worked on the first day and completely helped.
Fell fast asleep for the first few months, then I had to keep upping the dose and addiction set in. I had a horrible time with withdrawal symtoms. I experienced sever apnia while under the influence of Ambien and I hand morning hangover. It also agitated me and I experienced anxiety.
Acid in the stomach was reduced so that the reflux was kept under control.  Therefore there was little of no chance of irritation of the esophagus.
none, side effects that were intolerable were an increase in appetite and decreased libido
Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me.
Lamictal is by far the best medicine that I have been perscribed. It almost has completly controlled my depression which was very severe, and has almost completly controled my mania. I still get slightly hypomanic, but this has not been a problem for me.
The skin rash was better
sore throat healed due to reduction in stomach acid
Improved metabolism, decreased depression, increased energy, decreased hair loss, and improved finger/toenail condition.
More enrgy,better memory and concentration and clarity
Less reflux acidity
Cosopt reduced my occular pressure in both eyes by nearly one third which pleased my eye doctor. The treatment benefits are long term. Reducing occular pressure will prolong eyesight by preserving the optical nerves. Sorry not 50 words.
WORKED EXTREMELY WELL AT PREVENTING OUT BREAKS. an out break would come on and id start taking it and it would be gone withing 48 hours if i took it properly.
when applied correctly (i.e. minimal amount and mixed with a lotion that spreads well) it has been great for controling breakouts and reducing wrinkles and sun spots.
I added this medication 8 months after I began monthly infusions of Orencia. Orencia alone gave mild improvement in symptoms of severe rheumatoid arthritis. (I had extensive and severe joint pain and inflammation, severe edema in legs due to knee inflammation, and had very limited mobility.) Within 6-8 weeks of beginning Leflunomide (and still continuing Orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. As I write this I have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage I've sustained. Recently, I tried reducing my dose of Leflunomide to 10 mg/day. After 4-6 weeks or so, I began to have more symptoms. When I resumed the 20mg/day dose, symptoms decreased dramatically again - in about 6-8 weeks.
Toenail fungus was gone after 3 months of medication.
supposed prevention of catching swine flu
I haven't noticed too much of a difference so far.
I really did not see any benefit in taking the medication.  However, this may have been because I was unable to tolerate it for any length of time.
could focus slightly better in school and also at home
The ointment is easy to apply once the user realizes that the ointment is very thick, although Protopic on the face is ineffective or must be prescribed only for those conditions it has proven to resolve. In my case,  The rash continues to spread across the face.
None
THE TREATMENT BENEFIT IS TO CONTROL THE GLUCOSE IN MY BLOOD, ALONG WITH A HEALTHY DIET AND AVOID SWEETS AND STARCHES.
An almost complete cessation of pain in any arthritic place where there was not already significant joint damage.  More flexibility, more function, less exhaustion.  The difference was huge and still is.
Lack of pain
very effective allergy relief for hay fever
anxiety is supressed but not gone.





Depresion is 100 percent gone
I found that this drug immediately released alot of emotion - which was suprising.  I wept for about a week - I had no idea what was going on at first, and then I realized that - I could actually FEEL my emotions.  I felt normal and healthy.  I regret going off of this drug too soon, as I did.  I switched to Wellbutrin, which was not a good idea.
Severe symptoms of cold sores around the mouth were reduced and cleared up within 5 days.
Manic episodes have been minimised! Although having to increase my dosage gradually to get rid of the highs altogether.  Also puts me to sleep, whereas I used to be awake most nights from mania.
Less pain, less inflamation, slows down degeneration of disease. can function normally where before had severe pain in joints, especially in feet, knees, and made it extremely hard to walk, wear shoes, bend at knees.
less tired, more optimistic, more energy, no more depression
Relieved the plaque psoriasis which was over 90% of skin and extremely uncomfortable.
Very alert and extremely focused. I have a tremendous amount of energy with absolutely no jitters. My memory has improved and my production at the office has skyrocketed. I've been taking it for three months and it works as well as the first day I took it. It may not work for everyone but it works wonders for me.
The drug did help with the temporary depression.
No treatment benefit, because the complete prescription was not used because of adverse side effects.
To reduce the inflammation of the nasal polyp. By doing so, this should allow me better breathing. I was experiencing sleeplessness, due to inability to breathe well and also to have to sleep in a propped up position. Following the steroid treatment, I was able to sleep well again without all the snoring.
I usually slept through the night and did not experience drowsiness the next day.
My mood swings decreased, I was less irritable.  When I would be blue, I would not go into a deeper depression.  It just evened me out.  I also had a head injury and it seemed to help in the recovery from that.
i struggled with adult acne for 10 years and nothing worked for me. when i started taking this medication my acne completely cleared within 2 months and whenever i stop taking this medication it comes back within a few weeks and then will go away again when i start taking it again.
After battling w/moderate depression for many years, this drug is a miracle for me! It stopped the "hampster wheel in my head" anxiety I had, I feel mush calmer, I can focus on what is important, and I no longer have such emotional hypersensitivity that I used to. It helps me feel like the "me" that I had lost for a long time, but i have never had a "medicated" feeling from it,as i did with other antidepressants i previously tried.
Heartburn was lessened, but new symptoms began (possibly side effects) which made a new set of problems. Severe heartburn occurred 5-7 times a week before treatment, and was brought down to 2-3 times a week during treatment.
Since I was very young, a child, I suffered debilatating headaches.  Often they became true migraines.  They would last for days and days, sometimes weeks


without stop.  I missed school, parties, holidays.  I was scared to make plans


to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to


live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some


prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered


headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide


open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil


and within days her headaches subsided.  I went straight to my pain management


physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days


without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked


forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have


probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When


I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without


additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from


Elavil.  Thank you Elavil.
When he first started using the medication we saw remarkable results.  As time has gone by the results don't get any better, but it does keep his flare ups to a minimum and he doesn't ever have the big painful sores.
When BMI rating is over 27 its time to get that taken care of before it goes beyond that. I have taken adipex in my 20's and lost 30 pounds in 6 weeks. I keep it off until I turned 43.  You have to exercise or this will not work. I am not a fan of exercising but when you get the burst of energy get up and move. If you are stuck behind a desk.. turn from side to side... do stretches.. then at lunch or break move!!! There are so many looking for the magical drug for weight loss but there is none. Exercise is the magical word.


So get up and move it. walk.. dance.. or you will be stuck at the same weight. It takes work.. and a lot of it. It amazes me how there are those expecting a miracle in a pill. Not that way at all but it is a aid to get to your goal
For the most part the pain was taken away just enough that I could function.  I like that it's not a narcotic, yet gives some of the benefits of one.
Increased concentration and attention span, reduced appetite. Material studied remained more solidly in short-term memory.
Minimized pigmentation if not absolved them altogether. Good results for both hypo- and hyper- pigmentation.
Due to a car accident I sustained head injuries in addition to physical body injuries (broken bones, etc.)  I had terrible mood swings.  Through the assistance of a Psycharist subscribing Zoloft, gradually I became calmer.  I didn't cry as often for no apparent reason or get irritated at the drop of a hat.  My short term memory returned and I became less self conscious.
The treatment benefits included rapid pain-relief from the UTI.  Pain and symptoms of the UTI disappeared after the first week.  The drug was taken to completion to prevent reoccurance.
contraception
Initial LDL cholesterol reduced from 320 to 230 after 60 days. Continuing to take Pravastatin to further reduce LDL cholesterol.  HDL cholesterol is within normal range. Change in diet and weight reduction as recommended by Doctor is contributing to adjustment of cholesterol levels.
I felt so much better on the Prednisone, in the first 30 days, i could breathe easier and i did not get the severe dizzy spells i had been having
nothing has worked in relieving my migraine pain but I took imitrex when I felt a migraine comming on and within a half hour my migraine was completely gone
hairloss slowed down a little compared to before, but every now and then it came back. it might be normal sheddign which some would say is a good thing. sex drive went down. i also felt i was developing man boobs, i dont know if this was just in my head but i felt as if my pecs lost some definition. i therefore stopped taking the medication last month. have yet to see improvement in sex drive but hope it will come soon
The benefits of taking Lexapro, for me, were noticable within a few weeks at the very most. I wasn't as on edge. I wasn't as anxious. I haven't had any more anxiety attacks and Lexapro has helped me.
Acne decreased significantly when used in combination with the antibiotic erythromycin. The addition of spironolactone cleared up the acne that seemed to be triggered by fluctuating hormone levels. It also increased breast size.
Stopped seizure activity immediately, even during titration.  Occasional aura (pre-seziure activity which are actually seizures themselves), during high stress, or situations that trigger photosensitivity.
A little better than nothing.
I am an athlete, tennis pro and avid golfer. I experienced inflammation and swelling post knee surgery (tibia plateau fracture). Walking an 18 hole golf course can be painful for me, even after a year post surgery, I was in search of pain relief to continue playing a sport I love. Celebrex reduced my inflammation and stiffness and allowed me to play pain free.
When I started taking Zyrtec I had severe sore throat pain that I thought might be strep throat.  It turned out to be environmental allergies.  While I was taking Claritin for about a year, it wasn;t having any effect on these allergies.
It calms down the need to scratch,,gives me the ability to sleep at night,,,it also relieves my alergy symptoms(cough,sneezing,running nose)in general,,it keeps me from going out of my mind...When I don't use itthe itching will drive me up the wall. It mellows my mood,allowing me to act and react with others..
It really helps me focus better than my previous ADHD meds. (Concerta 25mg) I am a very spontaneous person (Sometimes maybe slightly annoying) I really had trouble concentrating in school and remembering what we learned. I was always forgetful, but now after taking it a few days, I nearly never forget anything. And I remember the material covered in class.
Immediate reliefe from my fribulation and a modest decline in blood preassure
Significantly reduced migraines frequency and severity
None
none
Reduced inner eye pressure which has slowed or possibly eliminated the disease. 


At the very least, the symptoms of glucoma immediately improved to normal and have remained at the normal range.
None
Very effective at preventing pregnancy.  Also regulated menstrual cycle length and helped relieve acne.  The best part is that you only menstruate 4 times a year, as opposed to 12 or 13.
While I did not have active Tuberculosis, I had tested positive.  Taking Isoniazid will prevent a future case of Tuberculosis from developing.
relieved the pain
Lowered my colesteral from 225 to 156.  Excellant results
the instructed me that by taking the antibiotic, it would surround the bacterias thus preventing further spread if the infections to other body parts.it really worked except that a nodule was left at the site of the boil. however, the drug gave me severe stomach aches due to gastritis before i went back to the physician to get some antiacids.
Initially I had Graves, then became hypothryoid post-treatment.  While hypothyroid I gained weight, had hair loss, was fatigued, cold and miserable.  Getting on a correct dose of thyroid replacement is great.  My hair returned, I became more fit and active.
the treatment benefits were that i did not get pregnant nor did i get a period. occasional spotting but nothing a pantiliner couldn't handle.
Xanax XR .5 once daily for 2 days. This med works within 20-30 mins. A good solution for fast anxiety relief, as opposed to waiting 2 weeks for it to "settle" into your system. I think I might have done fine with .25 instead of the .50.





However, just reading about other people's anxiety accounts and Xanax has given me anxiety!
Well i started having acne by the age of 18, but it wasnt like normal acne,big and red, it would only stay on the surface of the skin and it was white,it was like little dots all over my face.I used all the creams you could imagine but none of them worked,or would work for a few days and the pimples would come back again. I went to this dermatologist and he said that what could be causing my acne is the hormones balance, (if you have too much feminine or masculine hormones it can cause acne)so he said i could try to take birth control pill to balance my hormones. and so i started. In the first month my acne got worse,but i still kept taking Yasmin(birth control pill), on the third month i started noticing that my skin was clearing from all those pimples.I have been taking it for more than 6 months now and i have no acne! sometimes one or two comes out but it goes away in 2 days.So Yasmin worked for me and could work for you too!
skin seems to be producing more collagen and DEFINITELY has better texture and appearance. The low dose of HGH is something that needs to be considered as it really border a theraputic level. The bad side is the cost...500 per month at 1 cc per day. For men I cant tell you how happy I am with the low dose testosterone / Nandrolone (Deca) combination ( 100 mg per week). And generally speaking isnsurance companies DO cover injectable testosterone.
I have noticed a reduction in acne breakouts, particularly painful cysts.  I have also noticed improved skin appearance with more even skin tone.
none
Zovirax is a highly effective treatment of cold sores.  I take it in significantly higher dosages than the package indicates and 70% of the time, the cold sore diseappear within a day.
supposed to stop acid reflex, which it did for 2 days
Decrease in panic attacks (maybe these were hot flashes ... but didn't feel "hot"). Woke up less often at night from these same panic attacks.
it's admittedly very good at preventing pregnancy...


because well...it kinda stops the urge to have it.
The pill was very effective and i felt the relief from the pain considerably right after taking the pill
Reduces anxiety/worry. Really relaxes me and makes me feel much better and lets me sleep. I had major trouble falling asleep before taking this drug. Now I sleep like a baby. Very effective. Taken as prescribed there are no problems. A few idiots abuse this drug and thus the drug has gotten a bad rap unfortunately. Much better than SSRI's with way less side effects. It really makes me feel great. I take the .5 mg fast acting version, not the long acting version. This way it clears my system quicker and I can take it as needed and not worry about tolerance.
I started Topamax right after approval due to ongoing generalized (Grand mal) seizures that were resistant to other drugs. My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome.
helped the depression initially, was far more positive during the years I took it, but the efficacy of the drug began to deteriate, and the onset of new side effects led me to try to live without the treatment
No treatment benefits
Experienced 1 migrane in the past year since on seasonique - before seasonique I was getting a migrane at least 6-7 times a year during periods.  Not missing time with my family every month or work.
Always feel refreshed and clear thinking the day after.  I feel much better than I do on days I don't take it.
It eliminated the pain in my lower back for 8 hours at a time and after taking the full corse it seemed to have reduced the inflammation causing the pain.
My cholesterol levels were terrible.  I was around 32 years old with, as the doctor said, "the cholesterol of a 40 year old man."  It may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)!
Significant reduction in cramping, stiffness, and "knots" in muscles.
Treated a UTI bactrim did not
correction of thinning of hair, feeling cold all of the time, weepiness and feeling emotional.  improvement in fingernails.  correction of insomnia
Tramadol was prescribed for severe neck pain due to a bone spur that had grown into a nerve root in my neck. It was the only drug that could give me any relieve before I had surgery to fuse the vertebrae between C6 and C7 in my neck. It did not eliminate the pain completely, but made it very tolerable.
My melasma improved considerably, which speaks to the efficacy of the treament because I only used it for 7 days.
to help clear the airways after suffering from an asthma attack. improved my breathing for up to 6 hours after taking 2 puffs.
Although the medication has decreased my TSH level, I am still fatigued and inspite of being active at my job, I cannot seem to lose weight.  I have extememly low energy level which I thought the synthroid would help.
No exacerbations since starting during summer of 2008 after 11 years on Avonex (another "disease modifying medications" for MS.
Mood was more stable. Better quality of sleep.
I received no benefit from the medication.  My prescribing physician told me it would take a full six months of this medication taken daily for it to be effective.  That's not going to work for me.
I feel that Chantix is the best way to quit smoking. It was prescribed my my doctor. I smoked for 30 years. The only time I quit during that 30 years was when I was pregnant. I always started back up within a year. This time I know I won't start smoking again.
It help me get through the day with out a fast heartbeat. It calmed my nerves.
I believe I noticed some improvement in retaining information from conversations as well as from reading,including,but not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers. I also think I was clearer with regard to remembering events -the event itself, as well as the order in which things occurred in the particular event.
The infection cleared
Dramatic reduction in papules and pustules.
I was able to go back to sleep after waking and then to get up in two hours without any grogginess or after effects. The sleep I had as a result of the pill was very restful. This drug allows you to take a pill in the early morning hours, go back to sleep and then get up at the normal time without any sort of hangover. It is wonderful.
Sometimes it makes the difference to stress- related sleeplessness.
Lessening of most hypothyroid symptoms started within 2 weeks of taking the drug. Weight gain stopped despite positive dietary modifications and weight stability occurred, there were less incidences of dry skin, and menstrual irregularities went away.
nasacort eliminates stuffiness if taken at the proper times and right dosages. i have been advised by medical professionals that first administering over the counter med. such as AFRIN  (once)clears the passages first... then, when nasacort is applied the stuffiness is relieved for a longer period of time.. i find this to be true
The treatment benefits were clearly protection from getting pregnant as long as the pill is taken regularly without skipping. This pill is also touted as being one that helps in the treatment of acne, although I honestly can't say that it changed my acne pattern whatsoever. I tend to break out around the time of my monthly cycle, and I continued to break out even during the time I was on this pill. I didn't notice any decrease in my break-outs.
the benefits of taking Celebrex have been to reduce the inflamation caused by arthritis and degenerative arthritis. I have noticed releif from the soreness and stiffness that comes with this problem. Other than that I don't know what else I can tell you about this drug. Since there are fewer drugs available for this problem that are effective it has also been shown to be safe.
ease side effects of hot flashes, lost libido, sleeplessness, and to help bring my hormones into balance along with the estridol and testosterone
Elimination of night sweats, insomnia, irritability, stabilization of skin tone, no vaginal dryness
I'd had dry skin on my face for several years which I'd controlled using moisturisers. About five years ago, I started to get acne pimples and bumps on my cheeks and forehead which was diagnosed as rosacea. I was prescribed Metrogel which cleared the problems, including the dry skin. Symptoms reduced almost immediately. I've had about two years without having to get a repeat prescription, and symptoms have just begun to return, so I've requested more from my doc.
hormone balance. my estrogen was high during peri-menapause and this product got me back into balance and normal monthly periods.
lower blood pressure
resistant sinus infection cleared up completely
Did keep me awake.  Keep me going.  No heart racing, no dizziness, no nausia.  I would recommend this drug before any others.  It works wonders.  The acne that comes with it is bad. Very bad.  New pimples pop up all the time.
Did reduce slightly the sun damage brown spots and noticed a small lessening of tiny wrinkles.
Slight improvement of acne, but not enough to make it worth the treatment hassles.
Stopped 90% of symptoms
I was in a better mood. Less crying and less over thinking.
5-aminosalicylic acid, or mesalamine, belongs to the group of medications known as anti-inflammatories. It is used to treat mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis and mild-to-moderate Crohn's disease.5-aminosalicylic acid (or 5-ASA) acts by reducing inflammation in the bowel.
Stabilized moods. Made me feel like "me".  Allowed me to work much more effectively. Increased focus. Completely stopped crying jags (would get so down I'd cry over very little).
Benefits included decreased anxiey attacks.  It took approximately 2 weeks to see results but after that time it was a noticable difference.
I have taken this drug off and on for 20 years. It is so effective for my depression that I start feeling like I'm "cured" and don't need to take it any more. I have found that when I stop taking it, I'll be fine for a few days or weeks, and then I start feeling symptoms of depression again. For the last 3 years, I have taken it regularly and am not planning on stopping. It doesn't make me feel happy every day, because that's not its purpose, however it does keep me from entering a depressive state.
sore throat went away, cough cleared up; maybe it would have anyway, but at the time it seemed wisest to avoid getting a worse lung infection than letting it heal itself.
smoother skin, seemed to have more color, not so pale.  Smaller pores, diminished age spots, although they were still visible.
this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain, but in my particular case, i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual, physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years, i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition, and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate, it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence, and unfortunately, this is still a constant problem.  the prozac, i am convinced, has helped me keep these feelings in check, and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year, i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants, all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition, they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely, it has been absolutely invaluable to me, and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually, there has been a complete loss of libido, which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me, however, this is not a problem, because i am celibate, and have been for 20 years.  trust me, i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all.
My knee and leg pains lessened considerably after taking Voltaren orally
Reduced acne significantly and quickly.  I had severe cystic acne for about 3-4 months before trying spiro.  Within 2 months it was nearly gone.  I started on 50mg and that was enough to reduce cystic acne.  I just recently went to 75mg and that was to reduce small comedones.
lower blood pressure and preventing hypokalemia
It lowered the cholesterol levels overall but it is hard to tell if it was really necessary as numbers picked for "normal" ranges seem rather arbitrary. some people naturally produce more cholesterol.
made the affected area peel and removed the discoloration.
I have not gotten any benifit from this medecine, only side effects , I am still suffering of my leg pain, it turned that the doctor has given this medecine when not needed, I suffer from hernia and not tendonitis
The medicine kept the illness from getting worse, my cough loosened up immediately.  The dose and length of treatment was very managable, it was easy to remember to take one dose each day.  The packaging is very convenient - a blister pack so you know immediately how many you have taken.
freedom from depression, in addition, a greater interest in  sex
My acne was considerable decreased. I had hoped to see some anti-wrinkle effects as well but did not.
lowered blood sugar, improved mood, less fatigue in the long run
I was unable to get out of bed or see my friends. I hated going out to parties, going to class, or just interacting with people in general. After taking Celexa I found myself jumping out of bed in the morning and feeling ready to start my day. I started going out more on the weekends and my grades improved significantly. I was happy again and I felt like my life was getting back to how it was before I became depressed.
The stop of acid relux symptoms.  The stop of uncomfortable feelings in my esphogus.  The burning feeling and sensation.  Able to eat what i want when i want.
After using the Retin A for several months I did notice a decrease in the amount of whiteheads on my checks. My skin seemed to appear brighter and my complexion was not as splotchy. While I did not get any more whiteheads, it did not completely remove the ones I had.
The treatment was effective in reducing my "appetite" for smoking.  It also reduced my appetite for everything, including food.  Therefore, at first, I did manage to stop smoking WITHOUT gaining weight or being depressed about giving up the cigerates.  It just didn't seem important.
I initially had severe cramping and nausea, but I continued under doctor's orders, I only lost about 20 pounds, tops.  I now have a larger host of problems I believe were started with this medication.  I have not used in 3 years.
I have been plagued with peristent mutiple warts on my elbow for over 10 years. At Christmas - I decided to 'attack' the area again to clear it for the Summer. I used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 


I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin.
I only started this medication to still treat my Anxiety and mild depression, but eliminate the desire not to want sex.
Advair helped with my asthma initially, which was agrivated by an upper resperitory virus.
It got rid of a terrible ear infection. After 3 days, my ear infection pain was greatly diminished, but I kept taking it to be sure it was gone.
I didn't feel that there were any benefits. I initially started taking Wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. I really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. I immediately switched back to Effexor.
Improved ability to fall asleep
I felt better mood, optimism towards life in general, greater control of portion sizes. My recovery from anorexia was not easy, so I had a few months of moderate bulimia. It was then that my dosage grew bigger: 3 pills of 20 mg per day, though some days I would have 4 pills.
considerable reduction in fine lines,


smaller pore size


less acne,blackheads


general improvement in overall skin condition
Of all of the birthcontrol pills I've taken this was by far the one with the least number of negative side effects and it actually had several positive side effects.  It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way.
My acne scars continued to get better and better and eventually completely disappeared.
Within two days, the severe burning pain of the GERD disappeared. At three months of treatment, the pain from the ulcer has receded considerably. Because of the ulcer, however, I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic--very fresh pasta sauce with chunks of tomato--or too spicy.
Seroqel seems to calm my mind.  It stopped terrible mood swings and irritability as well.
Antibiotic seemed to work quickly.  My throat felt better within hours of taking the first pill.
On the 3rd day, I was extremely elated and more uninhibited than usual; headache was still present, but seemed unimportant. In addition, I slept through the night with the first two 50 mg pills.
I did not have to go through the change of life so early in my life, never really felt any change, at the time it was the best way to remove all the endrometriosis that i had, and it never effected me much as in pain or my womenhood.
According to my psychiatrist and to what I had read, lamictal could be very helpful for people with PTSD. I had tried dozens of meds over the years and, at the time, was totally crippled with anxiety despite being on all the other meds. listed above. Hours after starting Lamictal I was given relief and the anxiety and dissociative symptoms reduced markedly.
having suffered from asthma for most of my adult life, I began to rely on the albuterol (which should be only used as a rescue inhaler) multiple time per day.  After beginning the Flovent inhaler, my asthma was almost non-existent.
kept the high blood pressure normal. of course patient has also changed lifestyle - exercising four times a week, eating light sodium and low calorie foods. diet of vegetables and fish or white chicken, fruits and grains, no red meats. we believe it is both lifestyle and medication that have lowered the high blood pressure.
Reduced acne
Depression was gone for the first time in my life!  I finally knew what it was like to be "normal".
Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.


I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment.
Some pain relief, only significant benefit was during severe breakthrough pain and/or muscle spasms.  Excellent sleep aid.
Getting to sleep is easy as is staying asleep.  When waking during the night, returning to sleep was not a problem.  The drug did not cause sleep so deep that waking and being coherent was difficult.
reduced headaches and sneezing
Within about 2 days I noticed I had more energy.  I wasn't waking up tired, I wasn't craving sugar and coffee and my mood improved dramatically.  I stayed on the medication for about 2 years.  Gradually I noticed that I didn't need as much so I cut back on my dose. Eventually I went off for a year or two.  Then when I noticed the old symptoms of mild depression, tiredness, sugar cravings etc., I went back on.  I found that the natural form of Armour allowed my thyroid to kickstart.  After talking to many people who have used the synthetic form, they didn't experience this.  Their thyroid seemed to shut down and they had to always take the drug.
Relief of chronic intermittent pain. Also, relief from chronic ( post ) repeated surgery and repeated hospitalizations.
This drug knocked me out i did not wake during the night nor did I remember any dreams. It was difficult to get up in the morning.. This drug is an effective sleep aid but with recent concerns i think there are better choices...
bone scan showed no increase bone loss.
The abcess and inflammation around the area disappeared. It is very important that MRSA abcesses be treated immediately. If you have a history of MRSA, get to your doctor and begin medication as quickly as possible. Rifmapin is a very effective drug for MRSA infections. The doctor will do a workup of all the effective medications against your specific MRSA infection and choose the appropriate antibiotic.
i couldn't get pregnant
Had absolutely no problem with acid reflux while taking Nexium.
I live in a home with 3 cats and a dog, and was unable to breath in the morning secondary to all the animal dander.  After starting the claritin, I noticed a decrease in my allergy symptoms after about a week.
The pain from the muscle spasms was drastically reduced.
Immediately made me feel more focus, clear mind, energy, increase calmness. I started with 100mg once a day before work or in the morning on my days off and reduced to 50mg and still have all those benefits. Experienced little nausea, urine odor at the beginning. I don't feel like drinking alcohol anymore and if I drink too much, my hangovers are moderate. Very happy with it!
reduced hives associated with allergy. Lasted for 24 hours so did not need more than once a day. Was the only effective treatment. Doctor had switched to generic brand which did not work as effectivly. Available as otc now but I do not feel it is the same as the perscription strength was
Seemed to quiet the disease down especially during the first year.  Colonoscopy showed most of the colon healed after that time.  Fistulas no longer occurred and stayed healed and erythema on legs did not recur once I started taking this.
Having had asthma since I was a child, I have been using various medications for a long time. Thankfully I do not need to use albuterol daily, as I know some people do, but I use it as needed when I am experiencing an asthma attach. This happens on average once a month, less in warmer months, more during the winder.





As far as being effective albuterol, and the name brand inhaler is the best, and to my knowledge, still the only small inhaler that really works. I'm sure it has saved lives. With one inhalation I am able to breath again within minutes, this is even if I am having a bad attack, and am really strugling. So it is very effective
It eliminated my depression.
I had an infected jaw, an abcess under a back molar that inflamed the entire left side of my lower jaw producing a large ping pong ball sized swelling. This was probably -- my dentist suggested -- due to an infected tooth root that had migrated to jaw tissue.


After taking the drug, the swelling started to lessen in about 36 hours and progressively lessened over the next 5 days until it was not visible.
restored moisture, decreased itching, decreased urinary symptoms
Less frequent and less severe migraines
90% of new breakouts ceased after only 5 days.  I'm in about 9 days and my skin is fairly clear.  I'm very happy with the results.  My skin is not oily anymore either.  Also it cleared up my scalp problem that was pretty bad.
Not sure at this point.
Mucous very diminished, therefore, coughing has almost disappeared.  Not sure whether my condition is a form of asthma, COPD, or what, but this medication has so far certainly made it much less bothersome.
Lyrica has made a huge difference with my fibromyalgia pain. I have had fibromyalgia for 13 plus years and was excited about the FDA finally approving Lyrica for fibromyalgia patients.  I would recomend that anyone suffering from fibromyalgia try this medication, along with a healthy diet and exercise. Lyrica is not a cure, but I have improved probably 75% over this last year.
6hrs sleep per night. Vivid dreams. No other side effects exceptr morning anxity ++. Food tasted better at first, but this faded in a week. To sleep was good, but morning psychedelic effect no good. I sincerely doubt that the mirt would have been manageable without adjunctive benzodiazapine therapy and i wonder if the overall treatment out come would not have been better with benzo monotherapy as i presented with anxiety and insomnia and the M caused anxiety.
Did lower my blood pressure after about 3 weeks. Remained lower during remainder of course and after the treatment ended.
My oily skin vanished. The skin cleared up finally. the painful cysts went away for 4 yrs during each treatment. However they will come back (for me anyways) after 4 yrs with stress, mentral cycle, I get them on my jaw line even if i just hold a alcohol swabbed cell phone...Its from mechanical pressure. They last forever and scar me! So the benefits were great but so are the side effects...
by taking as prescribed, the drug prevents pregnancy, regulates period, helps reduce acne.
I always have at least three cold sores either inside my mouth or on my lips. I started this medicine while I had a cold sore with the help of the medicine and the Abreva the pain was decreased and it went away a lot faster.
less redness in the face
lifted mood from severely depressed to being able to live normally,still taking 75mg and pobably will be for forseeable future.happy to do that tho some of the side effects are not desirable it would be worse without it.helped with concentration and ablility to function.Also with confidence
Lasted all day long, could put it in a drink,
calm.  The reason that I went to the doctor was my son at 19 just reached full blown schizophrenia.  I was trying to find out his drastic change in behavior for about 4 years taking him to different doctors.  I drug tested him-none- alcohol-none.  My son was not the son I had raised. Started psychiatry doctors and diagnosed  with chronic paranoid schizophrenia.  Medication was prescribed.
The acyclovir was highly effective even though taken late - ie a week or more after I first got shingles.  It was still spreading 7-10 days later but once I starteed taking this medicine it did clear up.  I was also relieved that I had very little lasting nerve pain afterwards
The infection cleared
I was able to quit smoking after 7 days without major withdrawals.
The sinus infections start lightening up within one day, the pressure disappeared within two days If the antibiotics were not prescribed in a timely matter, the infection would have lasted for month. I would have lost all sense of smell and taste for a very long period of time.
By the 5th day, I was feeling much better.
The medication took all my simptoms away completely!
IT WORKED FOR RELIEVING SOME OF MY NECK AND BACK PAIN.  PLEASE NOTE, MY CAUSE OF PAIN WAS DUE TO SURGERY PAIN AND NOT YOUR NORMAL KIND OF BACK PAIN.  I MUST SAY THAT IT JUST KIND OF TOOK THE EDGE OFF OF THE SEVERE PAIN I WAS FEELING.


AS TIME WENT ON I BEGAN TO HEAL AND FEEL MUCH BETTER AND NOW IT TENDS TO WORK MUCH BETTER.
anti-inflammatory and pain reduction claims.  I didn't notice much difference in the pain but the inflammation went down after a few weeks (not while taking the medication).
The drug relieved the sore throat and lungs, albeit within two or three days.  I continued to have coughing fits only at night.
Hypothyroidism treatment -- restores proper thyroxine levels in body, not produced by my damaged thyroid gland. Without the medication, I would have not developed properly, and today I would suffer dramatic effects on energy levels, puffiness, cholesterol plaqueing and worse. Asthma and allergy treatment -- Ability to exercise without wheezing, ability to work outside among natural allergens, ability to clean around dust indoors,
The perioral dermatitis cleared up within the first week. I had been suffering with it for several months.


My acne cleared up significantly, but I still had the occasional lesion.
good hair growth
fewer breakouts (due to both Adapalene and Metrogel) and quicker healing time attributed to Adapalene.
Preventative control of asthma symptoms.
A slowing in androgenic alopecia, and some potential re-growth. The slowing of the male pattern balding creates an environment suitable for topical solutions to have stronger more effective yields.
no itching, no allergy, no dermagraphism
This ointment seemed to lessen the severity of the outbreak and duration.
Decreased eczema patches, however did not fully heal them. The treatment did not help my skin being scaly from eczema.
Before I began taking this, I had experienced a long time, chronic depression. After about one month of taking this I began feeling much better. Although things still are not perfect, and I have very blue periods, it has at least made life tolerable.
hydeoquione mitigated uneven tone of face as well as freckles.  It additionally left the skin with a taught texture.  My skin seemd to look 10 years younger
Acid reflux stopped, I am told that the damage done by the effluxed acid will be healed.  But I am not sure if this drug really strengthens the sphincter such that acid reflux is stopped.  Nexium mainly reduces acid production, but does is stop the efflux is yet to be seen based on the results after stopping the treatment.
No diarrhea and better drug efficacy.
cleared up cough and chest infection, although the treatment worked it was difficult at first to decide how much better it was making me as I had hot flushes, dizziness and diarroheah, all in all it took a good 5 days to start working
Much more relaxed evenings and better sleep.  Was able to sleep through the night.  Woke in mornings without back aches and pains.  Flexeril was effective as a muscle relaxant.
It truly cleared my headache in three days. I felt no reason to finish the meds unless it was necessary. That pretty much sums it up as to say I would recommend it to others in need. I thank the drug and pharmecutical industry much indeed. Again, Thank you.
Immediate benefits were realized, faster than my doctor anticipated. Also, I wouldn't always take Lexapro consistently, and when symptoms returned, by resuming Lexapro, I experienced results in 2-3 days.
I've taken various anti-depressants through the years, but this was the closest I ever came to a "cure". 


Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this "cure" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor "cure" so I delayed, hoping I would just "snap out of it" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no "cure" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference.
urinary tract infection subsided
I was given a short course of prednisone to take, along with whatever antibiotic I was currently on, whenever the antibiotic alone was not clearing up the sinus infection.  The prednisone worked like a charm, but at a cost.
i was told that i have high cholestrol and was very concerned about it so my doctor prescribed Lipitor. I had taken other drugs to lower my cholestrol, but they did not work as well as Lipitor, after taking the lipitor for 3 months my numbers dropped from 311 to 174. that was my goal and it worked... yay
I had hit the wall dealing with work, cllients,and family. My general physician asked me to see a therapist to help get me going in the right direction. After one meeting it was recommended by both caregivers that I take something to help me get through this rough spot. After about 3 weeks I started feeling like things were easier to cope with and I was making good decisions and getting things done again.
Treatment benefits from taking methotrexate included significantly reduced inflammation in the joints which led to reduced pain.  Overall fatigue was also minimized.
Reduction of symptoms ( extreme tiredness, mild fever and muscle aches, dry cough ) within 24 hours. Resolution of symptoms within 48 hours.
Prior to the Inspra I was on Spiractin, which I am back on now.  I took the inspra to reduce possibiity of gynecomastia, which was presenting in the form of breast pain.


My blood pressure normalised on both Spriractin and Inspra.
The medication is much cheaper than the other prescription medications like it and works very well.
Significantly reduced pain and swelling in lower back, hips, knees with in two weeks. Virtally no pain after one month. I have completey stopped all anti inflamitory drugs. Much increased range of motion and can now sit/stand for much longer periods of time with no pain.
I didn't take the medicine long enough to get any benefits
The 2 first day we're fantastic. I was easy going, task didn't birding me and I would overall say that my focus was good. However my well being was so great that I was mostly in my mind with great Joy.
erradication of actinic keratoses. Patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma
While I definitely did notice some improvement in my depression, I believe that Zoloft is far from being a truly effective antidepressant drug. My depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe, albeit not completely gone.
I originally took the medication in a smaller dose for 3-4 months and saw a reduction of pus-filled pimples. The physician increased the dose to hopefully increase the benefits, as I still had significant acne.
Within two weeks I found the hot flashes had subsided.  After 4 weeks I no longer had night sweats.  It took 3 or 4 months for my depression to get better.  The release from depression was tremendous and such a relief.
Reduction of acid.
All three medication, Alprazolam, Lipitor and Metformin were effective in treating insomnia, high cholesterol and insulin resistance.  Patient is evaluated every 3 months.
The treatment reduced the symptoms of SLE that I was suffering from: these were pain and inflammation in my wrists, hands and fingers.  It also reduced some puffiness in my face - perhaps b/c I had inflammation in my jaw joint.
the infection vanished after 2 days, I had already tried canesten cream and that did not help cure the infection fully.
Cholesterol was lowered but would have needed larger dose to meet desirable levels.
There were no treatment benefits--See below--I hoped to begin to see some effects after several months but because I had so much difficulty with it I gave up.
decreased bp
This drug works great for water retention because it is a potassium-sparing diuretic.  However, it had only a moderate impact on acne. It did seem to help with premenstrual symptoms and cyclical acne, but not a complete cure by any means. No apparent impact on blackheads/hard plugs.
Lowered HbA1C from 6.0 to 5.2 which has enabled me to go off numerous other anti diabetic medications which all had side effects.  The overall effect has been most agreeable including a loss of over 100 pounds of body fat.
symptoms were numbed, I was able to better "deal" with life and get through my days without crying or having a nervous epsiode
It was nice to not have to worry about a pill every day, you can put one ring in and then don't have to worry about it for 3 weeks.
The rx cleared up my conjunctivitus. It was fast & easy to use. I was surpised @ how quickly it worked. It does sting when you use but on the other hand as soon as the pink eye goes away it doesnt sting anymore.
Went from severely depressed before starting the medication to almost entirely free of depression a week after starting the medication; helped with insomnia.
Relief of migraine headache with in one hour and it stays away for 24 - 48 hours.  Migraines have been part of my life since I was 19.  This is the only medication that relieves my headaches so that I can function in my work and family life.
My skin felt much softer and my breakouts were far less frequent. My pores also looked smaller. The routine was also easy to maintain, as it only required nightly application.
Less severe mood swings and irritated moods.  Better able to concentrate.
My daughter is playing now finally and she seems to be feeling alot better. When she was hospitalized she was very ill she wouldnt move she was vomitting, diarhea, dehyrated, she had just a blank stare in her  eyes. Her kidney infection is very rare and i cant remember the name of it but it stars with a P.
I have seen a reduction in breakouts and a fresher,more even complection with a rosey look, and my skin is starting to normalize
This has enabled me to take half the amount of hydrocodone that I used to take.  The gabapentin potentiates the hydrocodone wonderfully.  It allows me to sleep better also.  It doesn't knock me out, just allows me to go to sleep when I want, dream, and wake up not groggy. I've also had fewer migraines since I've been on the gabapentin.
Before the use of vagifem tablets, I had to endure a series of urinary infections after sometimes painful sexual intercourse.  I also had painful cracks in mucoal lining of vulva due to aging and dryness.  After beginning the use of this drug, I found that the ncreased mucous in vagina resolved both of these problems.
It seemed to reduced blood pressure.  No other benefits were observed.
My skin was lighter in the area where I put Tri-luma.  The dark spot never did completely go away.
This drug alleviates my allergic responses--itchy eyes and sneezing.  It's effective because if I don't use it, my symptoms return.
Diarrhea lessened after about 8 hours, but not until after another 2 severe occurences. Had hoped for quicker, more effective response.
Increased energy; I happened to be without the drug for one week, and felt absolutely terrible - like I was completely knocked down.
No benefits.
Have not had any issues with rejection.  Patient has now be diagonosed with the JC virus, which has been a side effect of Cellcept.  Blood test must be taken weekly to check the fine line of not have to much or to little of the prograf in the system.  If patient did not have the JC virus, blood test would be less frequent.
The drug prevents the pustules that can result from Rosacea.  When I do not take the drug for a week, the pustules tend to reappear.

None
decreases episodes of mania, and provides a full nights sleep.
The medication treated the depression without the sexual side-effects that accompanied several other medications for depression.
Carac is used once a day as a topical cream in order to remove pre cancerous cells.  It did a great job of removing all bad cells.  I used it before going to bed.  I only used it 2 weeks because I had the reaction quicker than most.
The drug cleared my sinuses but took some time to become effective after use. The effect only lasted about half a day. I would take this off and on for about 3 months.
Actonel helped my bone density increase the first two years.
overall benefits were great. memory has not gotten worse and there is less frustration on my part. Makes my day much better. Although, I have peaks and


lows...my lows have been better.
The drug does get the patient to sleep very soon after taking the drug.
Calmed my crohns and inflamations. Allowed me to eat more foods. Made bathroom trips easier and less painful
My BP is in a normal range when I take this medication. I only require a very low dose.
none this stuff was awful -it hurt me -dont take it
The benefits of this treatment are the lowering of my bad cholesterol.  I would believe that the other benefits would be less build up plaque in my arteries.
I did not have any benefits by using hydroquinone
With in three days I felt the surge of energy that I expected. I no longer felt tired all the time. I was able to play with my kids more often and had the energy to work, clean, go to school, and still exercise for one hour a day. I felt alive and more like who I use to be. I'm happy again and currently have dropped 12 dress sizes thanks to my doctor and this medication he prescribed.
Depression free most days.
The Night sweats are almost non-existent now - occurring very irregularly and the vaginal dryness is remarkably better.
To reduce elevated prolactin and control the growth of the tumour
my usually oily skin dried up considerably and as a result the frequency of spots reduced.
The treatment benefits were huge - all hot flashes stopped within 1 week, skin dryness subsided, irritability was greatly reduced and energy levels are much higher.
I took it for three months and I did not feel any less depressed. I actually felt kind of paranois and "out of it." I did not fee any less depressed, in fact more anxious.
The treatment benefits included a decrease an abdominal pain, a decrease in diahrea and blood in the stool.  There were also benefits in overall comfort when dealing with day to day activities.  The decrease in abdominal pain and frequent diahrea allows me to perform my daily activities.
Experienced significant mood improvement in 2 weeks, increasingly more apparent over time. Where other medications had not worked, or had adverse side effects, Wellbutrin did not. This after several years of trial and error with other anti-depressants.
My husband started taking Aciphex when it first came out because he could not take any of the others. He started getting better after few months and stopped taking it afew times because insurance would not approve it. He immediately became ill and ended up in the hospital. Now after 6 yrs my husband has no symptoms other than occasional acid reflux when eating anything with tomato sauce.
I have taken Imitrex off and on for over 15 years. I have migraine headaches. Typically one tablet of Imitrex gets rid of the headache, usually within 30 minutes.
seemed to have a very mild calming effect
The drug was able to improve my depression and create balance in my life over the long run
Very little affects were felt on my throat
blood pressure lowered and water retention was decreased. overall I had less headaches and sinus pressure issues.
Hair regrowth in crown area
treatment envolved a reduction of pain and provided the ability to sleep
I used the product to try to reduce previous sun damage as well as discoloration and wrinkles created by aging (I'm currently 50).  I feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  Overall the condition of my skin did improve, however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further.
I have no more panic attacks, it helped to reduce anxiety, to improve the mood. I feel the old myself again and can function well at work.Sometimes I still experience anxiety attacks but they are not severe. I highly recommend this drug due to minimum of side effects in comparison with other antidepressant drugs.
Before taking Lexapro, I had constant anxiety.  I wasn't haveing panic attacks on a regular basis, but I was having them one in awhile.  My anxiety presented itself more in constant worrying, waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall asleep, and feeling tired but restless all the time.  I was moody and impatient, and obsessed about little, insignificant things all of the time.  Once I started taking Lexapro, that all changed.  It did all go away completely, but i can manage the slight symptoms I experience now.  I am much happier, much more stable, but more successful in my life.  I know others on it (my husband), and they have experienced the same kind of success.
Significantly reduced symptoms of menopause, including eliminated all hot flashes (as long as the drug is being taken), reduces skin dryness that occurred after hysterectomy, and preserved sex drive. 


preserve sex drive
My heart rate was rapid (usually 110-130 bpm) and I frequently had feelings in my heart that left my short of breath for a few minutes.  My heart rate slowed down to normal (usually 70-85 bpm) and I very seldom have these episodes anymore.  I feel much better overall and I do not have that feeling of "impending doom".  Also my blood pressure is good and I do not have to take an extra medication for this problem.
Miracle drug for anyone who's deathly afraid of giving speeches or oral presentations. Eliminates the whole butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling, racing heart, sweaty palms and allows you to focus on what your doing and do it properly rather than worry about how nervous you are.
Easy to use, no scent, absorbed quickly, rash cleared up
None that I had experienced.
This is the only treatment, besides cortizone shots, that had any effect.  My outbreaks consisted of opened , cracked sores (up to 9 at a time)on my fingers that were extremely painful. With a shot of cortizone every couple of years, Clobex takes care of the rest.  When I do not have an outbreak( and outbreaks are very mild if I treat them right away, I only use it a couple of times a week for prevention. I should mention that I need to be very careful and use gloves for many household cleaning tasks.
None, especially surprising since the prescription name brand Luvox had been used previously, with great results.  The Luvox stopped all ruminations and obsessive worry, while the generic fluvoxamine seemed to do nothing, and did not help with sleep.
Overall skin improvement: Skin feels softer, more radiant. Better complexion. Younger looking (my perception).





Skin turned slightly less oily. Number of blackheads reduced and became almost invisible.
Synthyroid replaces thyroid hormones that provide energy and increase your metabolism. I had a small goiter that was diminished when I began taking the medicine. If I miss a few days I have very little energy and feel as if I'm carrying heavy suitcases around.
Was able to successfully, and completely, discontinue illicit use of heroin/opiates.  I did remain abstinent for a period of time w/o it, but no longer than 6-7 months.  Always at or before that point I would wind up relapsing again, with no good outcomes.  Have stayed opiate-free for 1 year, 9 months now, and continue suboxone treatment.
disappearance of very severe symptoms of acid reflux and excessive stomach acid production which included ulceration on the esophagus and stomach lining.
maintain mood, decrease in depression, the combination of meds provided for a drcrease in hospitializations and lethality. More activity on a daily basis and a return to "normal" behaviot in re : to sleep patterns and appetite.
Reduced intensity of morning stiffness, reduced length of morning stiffness, reduced pain, increase in range of movement
No side effects, other anti-depresson pills usually made me stop taking them because of the side effects, but Prestiq had none. I actually felt better after taking my pill, I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly.
preventing pregnancy
I suffered with terrible allergies, itchy eyes, runny nose, sneezing and cough.  Using Flonase stopped all allergy symptoms within just a few days.
Did not notice much difference in decrease of rosacea bumps or redness but the bumps seemed to increase briefly after I got off the Oracea. For approximately one week after discontinuing use. I used in conjunction with topical Finacea, which I applied twice a day, also prescribed for rosacea.
When my allergies were acting up and I took it, it helped within an hour. It cleared up my nose and throat and made breathing easier.
I just filled all this out to get to read the info pack on skin care, but I accidentally logged out of it somehow and don't know how to get back in other than doing this all over again so that is what I'm doing - and I'm pissed.
It reduced my acne considerably and, after ceasing the treatment, I have never had acne as severe as before.
My acne did heal. I took it consistently for about 2 months and my acne healed up and my skin looked really good after a long time, but when I forgot to refill it, I started breaking out again. So after taking it again for a couple of weeks my skin started to clear up. I have not taken Doxycline for a few months now and my skin is doing good, besides the occasional break out.
pill added nothing to the treatment process
None
elimination of all symptoms related to the urinary tract infection including frequency of urination, pain upon urination, and urgency of urination
stopped circular thinking/anxiety.  Also allowed me to keep focused on tasks and what was going on around me.  eliminated suicidal thoughts and allowed me to be more positive.  Improved my relationship with others by allowing me to not be self focused and pay attention to the other person
soothing
The drug was very effective in helping me to fall asleep, and to get a good night's sleep.
reduce menopause related issues and improve quality of life.  Hot flashes ceased, energy level increased, overall mood and memory retention were impacted in a positive way.
I found the treatment was very helpful exspecially around my menstral cycle. I use to feel like I could crawl out of my skin two weeks before my period after starting zoloft I notice a considerable difference.I also felt anxious and restless which has subsided with the use of the zoloft.
I didn't know I was suppose to keep taking, so after one month, stop the medication & that's when the rosacea got worse & the eye involvement started.  I had to go to an eye doctor & get eye drops.  My dermatologist started me back on the doxycycline & said I had to take it "forever".
less sneezing, less nasal congestion, less eye irritation, improved energy, improved sleep at night.
to help heal several facial scar revision surgical wounds to heal faster.
I am using this on an as needed basis. I only take it a couple times a month, which is why 50mg still works for me.  I may have to go to 100mg though. If I have been up for 20-25 hours straight and if I am still "bouncing off the walls" (manic), then this is great stuff to have.


For as needed manic episodes and severe insomnia--this is great stuff.
I would sell my soul to the devil to obtain this miracle pill.  In a little as 30 minutes the intense pain and nausea are gone after one zomig.  I have had migraines since in my early teens where I was unable to function for as long as 48 hrs.  I have lost jobs, missed family outings and missed many opportunties due to migraine,  Zomig changed all of that and allowed me to take the medication and go to work and all the outings that I had missed.  I had a young family when I discovered Zomig and it was like a miracle was handed to me.
As soon as I felt a migraine coming on, I would feel very tired and feel dizzy at first and then the headache would come a little later. As soon as I could feel the headache I would take one tablet and within half an hour to an hour the headache would go and I would feel a lot better but still a little odd, a not quite 'here' feeling
weight loss right away.  I felt it working in brain right away, but lost the efficacy when I built my tolerance.  My MD gave me more and the same thing happened.





Meds don't cure add 100%, so now I take supplements.
This drug has changed my life.  I have had severe headaches most of my adult life- Imitrex takes the headaches away.  The only downside is that the drug causes me to be a bit drousy.
He was able to go to college and while he still wasn't the greatest student, he managed to get all assignments in on time. He rarely skipped classes. This was not at all true when he was in high school (prior to starting the medication.)
On Zocor my total cholesterol was lowered below 200 and my LDL was lowered below 100. I currently take Zocor 40mg and could probably reduce the amount I take to 20mg if I would dedicate myself to a serious diet and exercise program. I am a nurse and work nights so this is difficult. Zocor has kept my cholesterol down and reduced my risk for cardiovascular problems.
The treatment seemed to help considerably with the generalized brain 'fuzziness', lack of focus, fatigue and irrational mood swings that I had experienced on every other non-Zyban supported attempt to quit smoking. The treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal, or at least its perception, such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken.
I was hospitalized in January for suicidal thoughts/attempts. At the time, I had been diagnosed with clinical depression and prescriped antidepressants only. They would induce mania and I was totally out of control, so much so that I pretty much lost all of my friends and went through a divorce. At the hospital, I was diagnosed as bipolar and since taking Lamotrogine with Effexor, I've had no thoughts of suicide or cutting, which I used to do often.
Essentially there were no identifiable treatment benefits.
The treatment benefits were to counteract underactive thyroid conditions. Specifically, it kept my metabolism from being too slow, which meant that it diminished face swelling, kept my skin and hair from becoming dry, and from me feeling unusually cold and tired.
assisted with stopping smoking
Relief for my nasal clogging and breaht normally. Works great!
This muscle relaxer allowed me to sleep at night and wake up without a stiff neck. I was not in pain any longer at night.
I immediately felt my mood swings and irritability disappear and I became a nicer person again overnight. My partner noticed it immediately and I noitced it in myself. I havn't cried at all and  although I don't feel depressed it's more that all my feelings have been numbed! I feel that nothing affects me and that I am better able to cope day to day.
I started taking 30 MG's of Lipitor for one year; the next year I reduced to 20 MG's and have done so well, I am now (and for the past 3 yrs.) on 10 MGs per day. I have no side effects at all from this drug; and have blood workup done yearly.
Good cognitive enhancer.  I like that the effects come on very subtly and they also go away in the same manner.  I don't like to feel like I need a prescription which has no other (yet) proven benefits in long term cognition, I hope to either find another supplement to do something similar or see some research which shows Provigil has many more benefits than it does drawbacks.
made the condition tolerable so that I could work.  I am highly allergic to poison ivy and it lingers usually for three weeks.  On these drugs I was down to under two weeks and could still work.  Totally controlled the weeping.
Male patern baulding was reversed significantly.
I felt no pain from the extraction on the Vicodin.
decrease in acne, and less oil in skin and hair
The benefits of treatment were a lifting of depression, specifically as it relates to Wellbutrin, to elevate the ceiling of emotions. It also had a midly energizing effect.
It relieved symptoms of conjuctivitis including iching, dryness, soreness, buildup of mucus and sensitivity to light.  Symptoms seem to clear up quickly and render the patient non infectious after 24 hours of treatment.  It can be given to pregnant women with no adverse effects to the unborn child
The treatment benefits were that the skin on my face eventually returned to almost normal.  No more white scaly skin cells, no more red patches and lumps, which i think was inflammation, no more slight soreness, whilst using the cream.
My blood pressure levels were controlled quite well.  However,  they spike from time to time,  not dropping until I take another dose.
In general, I have enjoyed daily happy moods and more energy. I am able to focus on tasks better and can accomplish more each day. Mood swings, irritability, and temper outbursts are rare. I have gone from below-average to above-average coping skills. Feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts no longer occur.
The drug really did help the inflammation of the lungs and cut down on the cough.
My skin looked much better and my pores became much smaller. Many people remarked that I had a much smoother look. Also kept wrinkles from forming.
IT was to be for a sinus infection which was not able to be documented due to the immediate reaction to the drug. IT is normally prescribed for its antibiotic effect on the respiratory system.
Relieved pain, helped me fall asleep
none since could not continue treatment & diagnosis was made from routine, post-menopausal bone-density test (I was not having symptoms).
I gave up the drug within one week and dint expect any benefit within such a short time period
excellent birth control
I didn't get pregnant, because at the time, I didn't want to have another baby.
there were excellent benefits including the reduction of extereme burning sensation in the stomach, throat and mouth. Also a reduction in bloating of the stomack and cramps. i was also able to eat a more varied diet without the awful symptoms of burning and indigestion which normally accompany the acid reflux.
My skin definitely looks smoother and firmer than it actually did when I was 38 and started on the Retin A.
none
Used for weight management and food intake control.  It is also supposed to give energy.  It definitely worked for cutting my appetite as long as I took it twice a day.  If I took it once a day at about 8 am I would feel hungry at about 5pm.  If I took it twice a day 8 am 10am I could make it to bedtime without being hungry.
The medication was effective at preventing pregnancy
The benefits are less depression and better mood. It took about two weeks until I started to feel better but now I feel I may need something a bit stronger as I feel I am too used to taking this medication. I plan to ask for a higher dosage or different medication.
I AM GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE, UP EVERY 20 MIN. HOT FASHES/COLD FASHES, NO SLEEP AT ALL. MOODY. ( MAY BE FROM LACK OF SLEEP). ALL DAY WORKING ONE MIN HOT NEXT MINUTE COLD. I STARTED THE PREMPRO IT TOOK ABOUT  2-3 WEEKS BUT NOW I SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT NO HOT FLASH, NO COLDNESS AND NOT NIGHT/DAY SWEATING. MY MOOD HAS IMPORVED. I DID GO OFF IT  FOR 3 MONTHS AND ALL THE SYSTEMS CAME BACK. I WENT ON IT AND I WILL NOT GO OFF IT AGAIN. IT REALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR ME.
Dermatologist suggested trial of trimethoprim 2x per daily, once morning and once in the evening. Diminished acne resulted within the first month and more significantly for the following months. After 1 year, patient reduced to taking pill once per day.
After the first day on this drug, my ear pain was gone.  Sinuses cleared soon thereafter.
Lessened depression
The joint pain becomes considerably less within 24 hours of the shot.  I have more energy and almost no more nausea.
The benefits were not good, and this drug was very expensive and was not effective at all for the problem I was experiencing.  At the time when I was experiencing complications from the implants, I truly believed that my Doctor did not prescribed the drug in time.  The literature I read on this drug claims that it is more likely to work if used early in the treatment of Capsular Contracture.
Reduced prostate pain.
It reduced some of the side effects of depression such as insomnia, frequent crying and feelings of hopeless.
My eyelashes grew extremely long.
WEIGHT LOSS 2 STONE
reduce pain levels and resume daily life without interferance from pain. Reduce pain in order to proceed with physical therapy.
The tetracycline helped to reduce acne lesions.
Lexapro seemed to work well for me.  I suffered from panic attacks in the past and the Lexapro definitely helped with these.  The Lexapro also assisted with symptoms of depression.
Did not wake up in the middle of the night, HIGHLY IMPROVED quality of sleep, and improved body relaxation.  was able to stop using alcohol to stay asleep.
Never got pregnant
Significant reduction in feelings of anxiety, angry feelings, and social anxiety. Normalizing of affect, increased ability to focus on tasks and to cope with minor stressors. I felt a sort of reorganization of my thought processes, no longer brooded interminably about minor failings or ineffective social interactions or the presumed opinions of others about my worth. No longer hypervigilant about social cues. "So this is what it's like to be normal!"
checking myself considerably less, calm my mood swings, helped me think alot clearer,
I started using Retin A about 20 years ago in my late 20's to ward off wrinkles.


But even at .05% it was irritating and my skin would be fine one day and be peeling like a snake the next. When Retin A micro came out, my dermatologist reccomended it. It has worked much better with very little irritation. I use it nightly as the sun is supposed to render it inactive.I am 46 and with Botox have no wrinkles and little sagging
My total cholesterol was lowered from 237 to 165 in 4 weeks. My HDL (good cholesterol) numbers were up and the LDLs (bad cholesterol) went down. My triglycerides were lowered as well.
I have had stomach troubles my entire life. When I was pregnant they were unbearable.  I could never take the pill because of nausea. I noticed that when I was 45 the nausea was associated with my cycle, becoming most intense just prior to my period.  My gastroenterologist prescribed Nexium, which I took for a year, maximum dosage, daily and then tapered off. Then the other symptoms above emerged. When I started with the progesterone all these symptoms subsided significantly and I rarely ever have stomach problems now.
Always prescribed together with topical antibiotics such as Klaron.  Quite effective in curing acne, but takes months and situation gets worse in the first week to month.
The runny nose would stop about 30 minutes after I used flonase, but would return again within hours after taking the medication. It definitely cleared my sinuses, but sometimes left my nose feeling dry. Probably better as a sinus clearer than at alleviating all allergy symptoms.
Allegra minimized the allergy symptoms without the side effect of drowsiness that is typical of over-the-counter allergy medications such as Benadryll.  After taking the drug, congestion is greatly reduced and the constant sneezing stops.  However, Allegra is not very effective for itchy, dry eyes, which continues to be a problem during peak allergy season.
lower blood presure,ability to exercise for a longer period of time with out chet pain, same activity while on coreg results in an average reduced heart rate of 20 beats per min.when off the drug exersise tolerance was greatly diminished resulting in angina
Cleared up the sinus infection quickly, felt effects almost immediately (less pressure, less pain, less pus being expelled)
it cleared up my skin not just from acne, but also from hyperpigmentation
Dapsone treated the intensly itchy skin condition quickly and efficiently.  A gluten free diet alone did not relieve this condition.
Before Armour I was taking synthroid, and had huge weight gain, depression, mood swings, etc. After switching to Armour my brain cleared, I had less problem with at least keeping my weight on the same level, no muscle cramps anymore
My skin is clear and people have complimented me on the appearance of my complexion.  My rosacea is under control, my hyperpigmentation is fading
Completely cleared up the condition. Without using messy creams, or powders.  Prevented it from spreading to other body parts.
The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially, it increased my energy and focus, and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a "zombie" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me, which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants.
I switched from Diane 35, a birth control pills recommended specifically for acne and was very worried that the nuva ring would cause an acne flair up, as switching from Diane to Yasmine had. Fortunately my skin stayed just as clear and as a plus no more taking pills nightly
Cleared up pneumonia infection.
eliminated my pain which allowed me to function at an almost normal level. i was mostly bedridden prior to treatment

well, the main treatment benefit was that it did help me go to sleep faster, even better than the melatonin that I was taking before i went to bed. Another benefit of taking this prescription drug was that it helped me with my anxiety. I have considerably much less anxiety than I did before taking this.
Increased productivity, ability to stay awake during the day.

It is oral tablet available in both 5mg and 10mg dosages
none
I must have tried 15 different blood pressure meds over the last 7 years.  None of them worked.  I was on Benicar, but the insurance no longer covered it.  So my Dr. switched me to Losartan.  WOW, what a difference.  I now have perfectly normal blood pressure.
allowed me to focus on the tasks at hand, run a business and get things accomplished
I have trouble sleeping -- I usually toss and turn all night, sleep a couple of hours and wake up.  Normally, I never get a complete night's rest.  After my doctor prescribed Lunesta, it was the first time in a very long time, that I was able to sleep from the time I laid my head on the pillow until my alarm sounded in the morning.
I am able to fall alseep within the 30 minutes of taking the drug. The drug helps with anxiety so I worry less while waiting to fall asleep.  I usually wake


up only once to use the bathroom compared to 2-3 times when I didn't have the drug. I wake up refreshed and it Cheap too.
no nausea, less vomiting.  able to get through work and school feeling better
insomnia
It took the edge off of my stress and anxiety level and helped me feel more present and even-keeled.  I started taking it during a difficult period and it helped lighten my mood.  I did not feel like I was numbed or that I was unable to feel highs and lows.
Generally effective in stabilizing mood fluctuations and controlling obsessive thought patterns, mild anti-depressive effect
Aromasin's treatment benefits are unknown.  I have not had a reoccurance of breast cancer while on the drug, though unsure we can attribute that with the drug treatment itself.  Perhaps there are other positive health-related items coming into play, such as exerciase and eating habits.  Not aware of any side effects or adverse reactions.  Drug is very expensive, however.
Resolve my itchiness and redness at both joints of my arms and the "circular" itchness spots went away couple days after application
Reduced pain, helped with sleep
Eliminate yeast infection
I had very bad lower back pain with spasms and considerable swelling on my left side, to the extend that when standing, I was leaning to my right.  Flexeril took care of most of the pain and much of the swelling.
Completely ceased all anxiety, and I am now able to participate and enjoy life fully.
depression greatly reduced, anxiety lessened.
short term relief from breathing problems. especially beneficial when patient was experiencing other health issue like cold or flu
enabled me to quit smoking, I think it works well, and even better combined with zyban/bupropion
It worked but then I became addicted to methadone so basically it just traded one addiction for another. I don't take as many Methedone a day as I did pain pills because Methadone is long lasting so I guess it did help me.
60ml of Prednisone saved my cornea transplant.


Saved me from having to have another surgery on an already tramatized eye.
Vyvanse has greatly improved my mood and the way I look at the day .I am able to concentrate and finish a job. I am also in a much better mood than when just on the antidepressant. I am less  prone to get angry ,irritated ,impatient and to "fly of the handle".I take it after lunch and it keeps me going till at least 8 pm. I accomplish alot more in a day. And best of all feel good about myself.Vyvanse does not give you that dropped feeling when it is wearing off.
None
To tell the truth, I did not benefit very much from this medication, even though I was taking maximum doses, the pain remained almost the same with or without medication. Maybe some people are more responsive to these kind of treatment, unfortunately not in my case.
lowers blood pressure and helps prevent strokes. Helps the patient to function without the tingling, headaches, and chest pain that comes from having blood pressure too high.
Loss of depression, reprieve from PTSD symptoms
Decreased Blood Glocose Levels. Decreased appitite. Less cravings for carbohydrates.
I began taking this medication during a very unstable period in my life and when I had been rapid cycling and experiencing mixed states, and over a 2 yr period it greatly helped increase my self-worth and overall stability. It helped me to get control of my life and avoid the severe depressions I was prone to, as well as putting a cap on my manias. I still felt mild highs or maybe natural euphorias but they are not manic-y and crazy. I even started being able to get sleepy at a normal hour and wake up in the morning. While on the medication I feel much clearer in general in my thoughts, so if I still feel down or up I am more confident in my ability to manage it. I feel like I am not overly leveled out and blah like I felt with Depakote, more like I avoid the worst and can be in control.
Pain, (which was not controlled by Acetaminophen w/Codeine #3), was reduced to a manageable state with Ketorolac.
less depression/anxiety
The ointment kept the symptoms of the dermatitis(i.e. itching, scaling and cracking) to a minimum.  As long as the treatment was part of my daily regiment it was very effective.
The Paxil relieved my anxiety and mild panic attacks at first. After time my doctor needed to increase the dose to get the same effect.
Regular use of Retin A cleared my acne dramatically. Initially, I experienced and increase in the presence of acne pimples and moderate redness and irritation. This lasted for a couple of weeks as my skin adjusted to the medication. Within about six weeks, I would guess my skin was 75% clearer. Over the past twelve years, I have experienced only rare pimples which resolved quickly with little or no discoloration. One important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products, and use plenty of moisturizer. Scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse.
Total recouperation from a long battle with acid reflux and stomach pains.
Alleviated my despair, gave me back some control of my emotions and motivated me to work harder at managing my depression and get out of the house.
This was recommended to me instead of Gaviscon.  Supposedly it was a better solution for my indigestion.  Instead it was a disaster.
The benefit was a reduction the fatigue that I was feeling on a daily basis.
After weeks of use, I did see a considerable decrease in pimples on my face.  Being in my 40's, I saw a benefit in my skin tone also.
My headaches were less frequent, less severe, my PMDD symptoms decreased drastically.
I could not observe any benefits: my blackheads remained as they were, and acne remained. Probably my problem was not severe enough to see the results, however, due to no observed change I stopped using it.
The pain was greatly diminished and I was able to live my life in relative comfort.
better sleep, less raciness
Started taking this drug in 2002 due to a high TSh reading, asymptomatic. Took it for 8 years raising my dose after about 5years from 50 mcg to75 mcg. Six months ago I developed panic attacks,speediness,anxiety,gastric issues,dizziness very suddenly with a sudden drop in my TSH from a steady 1.8-2.0 to as low as .20.  Continued to take the Levoxyl but dropped dosage back to 50mcg and hope to become asymtomatic shortly. Take Xanax for the panic attacks as needed. Am hoping to perhaps supplement the T4 with T3 Cytomel or something for the depression.
I used to have at least 3 herpes outbreaks in the course of a year. These would interfere with personal time with my spouse, backpacking trips, day to day comfort.  In the time I have taken Valtrex I have not had one outbreak, and don't have to think about it any longer.
I felt relaxed, could sleep, good drug to be lazy on. If I felt panicky and wanted to relax I could. I don't have alot of benefits to say because I think the grouchiness outweighs the good side effects to me!
patient took this drug to help with concentration and focus problems occurring in a classroom environment with many distractions.
Completely stopped hot flashes and night sweats. (I think there was also some mild improvement in skin thickness as well but it certainly did not end cellulite!)
It took the "edge" off the pain, for sure.  Without the medication I don't know how I could have put up with it.
Less pain in joints and back. Was able to do activities with my daughter  again. I stopped taking it for about 6 weeks and noticed a significant increase in pain. When I resumed taking it and symptoms faded.
The benefits of taking all these asthma medications is that I have been pretty much symptom free.  The Flovent has been particularly helpful in preventing flareups of my symptoms which has greatly reduced the need for my Albuterol.  The benefits of taking the Keppra is that I have only had one seizure episode since I began treatment in 2006.  The episode lasted only seconds.
Noticeably lowered blood pressure and stress level when taken.  If the patient missed a dose, he became more easily agitated.  When the Lipitor was administered, agitation would subside within 1/2 an hour.  The patient has a family history of hypertension, heart disease and sleep apnea.  Therefore, controlling hypertension is a major concern for this patient and may actually save his life.
Regained hair growth. Minoxidil first increased hairloss (normal during the first weeks of using). New hair started to grow after around seven months. I have not regained my normal hairgrowth. The hairs itself have a slightly larger diameter and are bit more curled.
It started working immediately which was wonderful.  My energy level increased, I was more interested in going out rather than hiding in my house.  I've increased to 100mg 2x's a day.  I've lost approximately 25 pounds but I think that's because of an interaction from the Concerta & Lamotrigine.
Until 10 days ago never took an anti-depressant, GP encouraged me due to my fatigue, low mood, agitation and within 4-5 days I found myself much more laid back and smiling at people more, usually because something is said and I see a funny side to it.  I know it ism supposed to take 6 weeks to work but I am changed or else back to myself.  My husband is pleased as I have stopped shouting at him at the least thing.  I have more energy and much more optimistic
loss of stiffness and more mobility.  After a heavy weight workout, taking Miotrin relieved the stiffness and iflamation around lower back.  Next day mobility and flesibility was much greater, and less pain.
The treatment benefits for Renova are more skin clarity.  Also, i believe the freckles on ;my face are fading quite a bit.  The fine lines did not really get any better. My skin is not really that different to notice real changes
i had clear clear skin. my skin was so acne free it looked like a photo shop picture. but that is the only positive to this birth control
Stopped hair loss, restored skin tone, normalized body fat/lean ratio, restored energy, restored normal sleep pattern and quality (had been waking feeling groggy, never felt rested)
I have had excellent results with the drug.  I no longer have a negative or indifferent attitude towards life.  I am generally content and am capable of enjoyment.  I am still capable of feeling appropriate negative emotions but don't get stuck in them.
Reduced symptoms of seasonal allergies.
I dont have days that seem so dark that there is no hope for the future any more. If I am up set about something I can still function and not spend time hibernating and not functioning. I sleep regularly where before I had nights where I would not get any sleep at all. Activities are more enjoyable. I enjoy life more.
My mood swings lessened, only benefit
less hirsutism, reduction in acne, reduction in oily skin and oily hair
lower top/bottom reading numbers. I really don't understand the readings but initially they were like 140/90. now they read 120/70.
Imitrex has been a godsend.  After years of suffering pain and interruption of life due to migraines, just one little pill, either at the onset of pain or even when migraine is full-blown and pain is reliefed within 30 minutes.
It effectively treated my maxillary sinus infection.  No more smelly nasal discharge and I could see the result within the first day of taking this drug.
Stopped the constant racing thoughts at night.  Finally could get some decent sleep.  Before I'd lay in bed for hours on end thinking and thinking over and over until I was nuts.  Now am able to sleep an entire night through with less paranoia to boot...
reduced time to heal after an acne outbreak
Xanax is extremely effective and works very quickly.I have also noticed that some days I might not need it at all.I neither smoke nor drink alcohol so do not consider myself an addictive personality.Just need some extra coping skills for highly stressful emotional domestic situations
Byetta will raise insulin production in the presence of increased blood glucose only, and do so gradually. It reduced my post prandial readings substantially, and also (when taken at least 30-60 minutes before meals) slowed gastric emptying, allowing me to feel full quicker and eat less.
I had swelling and pain in my knee from itbs and in my ankle from tendenitis and it took down the swelling
Moderate relief from headache. Sometimes complete relief from the headache where I can continue on without a headache for several hours.
My name is Nick Gikas- I considered myself a bit of a playboy until I caught a dose off a 54 year old pre-op tranny hooker-$250 NOT well spent. However, after seeing my local friendly doc and spending considerable time in hospital, this stuff cleared up Mr Tiny in no time. However, my arse is still in tatters and I've had to downscale from marrows to cucumbers in my spare time.
blood pressure in check just have to visit the doctor once a year blood pressure now is 80/130
Fell asleep within 20 mins of taking the drug; sound sleep all night long; no hangover effect the next day.
Required only one application per month, rather than having to take a pill everyday. Was also a lower dosage than the pill, which seems better. Because it is not ingested there was no nausea.
Depression lessened considerably after 6-8 weeks.  Anxiety & depression not totally eliminated, but after initial 6-8 weeks of treatment patient was better able to deal with depressive thoughts and worry.  Allows patient to live a functionally normal life.
I was able to reduce my dependence on Verapamil down to 240 mg. when I added the Diovan
Reduces the symptoms of pseudomonas chest infection for a few weeks, especially the haemoptysis.
Lower blood pressure
I felt immediate relief within 24 hrs - 2 tablets
Cleared sinusitis very quickly. Ended a hacking cough after about a day as well.
Improved sleep, reduced night sweats.  I was experiencing extremely severe insomnia as a result of hormonal fluctuations.  I was down to about 2-4 hours of sleep a night and had tried many approaches, including meditation, herbal supplements, etc.
I lost 40lbs the first time I took it in only 2 months and kept it off for 1 year. I gained 20lbs back after that. I'm taking it again now and loose back down to my normal weight, stop taking it and gain all the weight back plus some. I've done this three times now even with an extensive workout routine and very healthy eating habits.
This regimen eliminated, for the most part, the pain, stiffness, and exhaustion experienced with rheumatoid arthritis.
Reflux under control
My staph infection on my neck and legs started to clear up pretty quickly... within the 2nd day i noticed a huge difference.
there was no more back pain so i felt relaxed. Tramadol also cleared migraines quickly.
The pimples become dry. At first there was formation of new pimples, but then pimples started gradually go away; overall the skin started looking healthier and cleaner.
No benefits, did not help the initial problem of the sinus infection
none-I'm still taking it until the bottle runs out (like 3 more months) but I'm not optimistic. My dermatologist said toe nail fungus is really hard to treat. I have it on my big toe and it's not pretty. I tried homemade remedies first-white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide and Vicks vapo rub (which didn't work either but I swear better than both of the medications) The I tried Naftin gel for 3 months and now the paint-on Penlac generic.
Drug offers reliable pain relief with little negative side affects. Pain in neck, left shoulder, arm and hand.  Numbness in hand and fingers. Did not experience any nausea, dizziness.
reduced blood pressure and less water retention in legs and ankles
The drug got rid of the acne but the problem reoccurred a year later
Premarin had a postiive effect on my moods, my skin was less dry and wrinkled and my weight gain distribution around my stomach decreased. In addition, my overall weight loss increased with proper diet and exercise. Prior to increased Premarin, this was not attainable.
When I was taking the medication it did lower my cholesterol. I cannot recall my exact cholesterol levels but they were high because at 30 years old my DR prescribed Lipitor. When my Dr. resteted my cholesterol levels he was impressed. Lipitor worked wonderfully and I was out of "dangerous" cholesterol levels.
Stopped the body's reaction to anxiety attacks
stomach did not hurt any more. no more reflux in the middle of the night.I did not have to take it with any regard to food. the once a day dose mad it easy,did not have to take doses with me to work.
Worked very well to relieve depression and anxiety.  Left me feeling overall much calmer and more content.  Little things just wouldn't bother me anymore.  I stopped caring about things that used to upset me.
After 4 to 5 days on the medication, Claritin greatly reduces itchiness, sneezing, scratchy throat associated with seasonal allergies
none
Been using retin-a for 9 yrs but had to start adding doryx due to resent cystic acne around my chin area, i noticed within a few days my skin has been glowing and my pores are much smaller. Its cleared up 80% of my acne and still seeing improvement
The burning in the legs are now tolerable.
Doryx taken to eliminate bateria that causes acne
I was led to believe my bone density would improve with this drug and it would only need to be administered once a week.
I have had asthma for years and take albuterol.  I heard about this new inhaler from a physician at work. He stated that it was a more pure form of the drug.  At the time he stated it was expensive to get. At the same time we were finding out that albuterol was being discontinued.  The replacement had a horrible taste to it. My son who has severe asthma was even refusing to take the new inhalor. I asked my physician for it specifically at my next visit. He did not hesitate to provide me the prescription.  My insurance company doesn't pay much of anything so I worried they would not cover it and they did.  I was very happy that it worked so well with no funny taste.
they helped to reduce headaches that I had been sufferein over a period of over 2 years
It somewhat relieved my heartburn for a few days.
To start with a numbness to the pain then my life was turned upside down.
eliminates stuffiness.  best when applied after one dosage of over the counter (afrin ) or similar.
Acne healed quickly with no other adverse reactions to the drug.
Immediately controled palpitations associated with mild to moderate mitral valve regurtitation
it gave a little respons but once we stop applying the spots appear again so it is frustating to keep on applying.it is not a cure but just a satisfaction.
None!
When taking the Accutane I noticed a decrease in the amount of acne I had on my face over the course of the treatment.
The combination of Lamictal and Effexor eliminated severe mood swings betweens hypomania and depression, and made my depression manageable.
I was excited to have only 4 periods per year, but I never got that far, as I quit taking it after six days because of severe depression, crankiness, fatigue, uncontrollable hunger  water retention and weight gain.
will see with time photo damage reduction.  Sun exposure ++ growing up in South Africa so fine lines and facial scar due to dog bite.  I have some medical training so am interested to see if any skin improvement
I found that I actually felt worse rather than better, the only benefit was that with  imovane I could sleep at night which I couldn't do earlier. I never really felt rested though. I am not sure if the combination of these 3 drugs caused my anxiety to become worse. Venlafaxine was supposed to help my depression but I found it totally ineffective. I am wondering if I get a higher dose will it help but I am afraid it might make it worse . WOuld love to go off all of these medicines as I feel the side effects are worse than the depression
I had my first migraine at age 10 and suffered for almost 60 years. Then Imitrex--a miracle!  Imitrex, finally, gave me my life back. As I get older and am now retired (72) and have less stress, I use the stat dose once or never during the year. The 50mg tablet usually returns me to normal within an hour. A "generic" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin, an anti-inflammatory,  which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However, Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage, not wanting to pay the high cost, which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent.  Now I'm worried, having to pay the entire cost myself, which is impossible.  It's a horrible dilemma.  I can't pay for it and they won't.  What now?
I had swelling and pain in my knee from itbs and in my ankle from tendenitis and it took down the swelling
Did not get pregnant, regular periods.
Occasionally, acne would subside slightly.
I have found the product to be the only thing to work for autoimune Ulcerative Cholitis.    I was diagnosed with UC at age 43 after extensive testing.   Tried several other products and supplements to keep UC in remission but none have been effective.  The price is very expensive and is out of the reach of those without insurance cost is in the price range of $900 per months.   The company that makes the drug does offer programs for the non insured to receive at very substantial discounts or at no cost
I noticed an improvement in my thinking within 3 days.  I began to think more positive and objective.  I also began to sleep much better, to much for quite a while.  After a couple weeks, I was not nearly as depressed and it kept getting better.
The Sulfer drug helped reduce abdominal inflammation and reduced pain felt with Crohn's flare ups.
I am 28 and had acne like a 16 year old the day before the prom. It was horrible and embarrassing. This was an experiment. We had no idea if it would even work. We started at 50mg twice daily and then went to the 100mg when there were no results. My face is flawless now. I am also sleeping better which I don't think is a coincidence.
Patient was in second year of law school when began taking Lexapro; anxiety lessened as did depression, however didn't improve motivation to study.
It kept me at a low-functioning level (work and occassional activities), which was an improvement for me.  It kept me functioning due to decreased depression.  I had taken it for a few years on and off before finally switching to another drug two days ago due to the drug becomming no longer effective.  When I was younger and the drug was new to me it was much more effective.
Benefits were I was able to stay awake during the day. And now that I have esophageal cancer I strongly believe Nuvigil is a big help with the side effects of chemoradiation treatments.
More mellow mood. Just taking Wellbutrin alone wasn't enough. I am a mild bipolar and needed something to balance out my moods. I have both depression and anxiety. And do not sleep well. That's why I was on Ambien, too.
The drug was very effective at first at getting me out of depression.  However it lost effectiveness over time and the side effects became worse over time.
Some reduction of pain
I had severe anxiety attacks and once they would start it was very difficult to decrease their intensity.  My heart beat got as high as 160bpm on two occasions.  I found the .25mg Xanax pills to be very strong so I only would take 1/4 of a pill, which was enough to stop the attack or prevent one if I felt one coming on.
Metrogel 1% significantly improved the redness on my cheeks, nose and chin within 3 weeks of use and reduced breakouts of papules due to rosacea triggers.  It was easy to use with no drug interactions.
The tremor is most noticable in my hands, with fatigue my head also becomes tremulous. Inderal is the most effective medication I have taken to control the tremor. Benzodiazipines were tried early on and were ineffective.
Since starting the plavix and other meds, I have had no strokes.
None/ had to many painful side effects.
Practically pain-free. Durins a flare-up I sometimes take a 50 mm pill in order to get more short term relief as opposed to the extended release pill.
The treatment did not affect the level of joint pain that I experienced, nor did it improve joint stiffness. I cannot comment on it's effect on inflammation as my inflammation tends not to be visible anyway. <i This may be the reason that Naproxen did not benefit me</i
Well... what can I say? During the treatment I mentioned a considerable pressure decrease, and for sure it was a notable blood sugar decrease. I would recommend this drug to evedybody with sugar diabetes type II.

CLEARED UP ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND HAVE NOT HAD RELAPSE SINCE. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THIS ILLNESS WHEN I WAS 18. I LOATHED THE INVESTIGATIONS SO MUCH THAT I ONLY KEPT APPOINTMENTS TIL I WAS ABOUT 21. I STOPPED TAKING THE SALAZOPYRIN WHEN I WAS ABOUT 22. I HAD OCCASIONAL PROBLEMS BUT NOTHING THAT DIDN'T CLEAR ITSELF UP. I WENT ON TO HAVE 3 HEALTHY CHILDREN. HOWEVER IN 2001 THE PROB CAME BACK WITH A VENGEANCE AND I NEEDED SURGERY AND WAS VERY ILL - IT WOULD HAVE HELPED IF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION HAD TAKEN SOME INTEREST IN ME AND HADN'T SIMPLY TOLD MW I WAS TRESSED AND TO GO AWAY. PRIVATE CONSULTATIONS FINALLY MEANT THAT I WAS REFERRED TO A CONSULTATN AND HAD THE SURGERY
none
My son came home from college with the flu. Student Health gave him a pack of Tamiflu and he felt better within 24 hours. When I started feeling sick 3 days later, I called my Dr and ask for Tamiflu. I felt almost back to norma lwithin 24 hours.
none noted- moderate pain relief of arthritis
easy prevention of pregnancy.
This medicine improved irritable bowel symptoms of cramping and constipation. No diarrhea was present before or during course of medicine.
stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again.
The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.
Prevented pregnancy, helped clear mild skin breakouts, keeps the menstrual cycle on a specific schedule, can alter cycle by having doctor let you know how to change your intake pattern for the pills.
immediately stopped getting acne.
The hair on the crown of the head significantly and visually filled in to the state it was 5 years earlier and has maintained this growth since.
It greatly reduced the pain in the lower back and upper thigh muscles.It reduced the amount of spasms I was having in my lower back. I could not function as well if I did not take it.
less acne, brown spots somewhat faded
Imitrex was the miracle drug for me at first. Suffered with migraines since the age of 7 and never got relief except through ER shot of stadol/phenergen starting at age 27. So when doc gave me imitrex shot the first time I thought I found my miracle. 


It does get rid of the pain completely. I have no complaint about that.


I used to only get migraines once or twice a month.
The furrows (lines above my eyes) on forehead disappered. They started reappearng after about three months. I looked younger. I also didnt look look like i was frowning all of the time.
allowed me to function rather than having to spend 2-3 days in bed
More energy, clearer mind, no depression.
Sustained focus, improvement in attention span and greater achievement of daily tasks.  Easy to take, just one pill a day!
Well, I started on Flexeril about five days to a week ago. I felt a calm feeling and also it kind of helped my anxiety. It helped my headches a lot.
decreased anxiety
there were no treatment benefits only bad side effects such as terrible nightmares, hyperventilating
Control of Panic Attacks that interrupted daily activity. Treatment of sudden increased anxiety, tachycardia, shortness of breathe, due to stress, general anxiety disorder.
I began using Vivelle patches shortly after my hysterectomy five and one-half years ago. I have more stability in my moods w/ better emotional control. I have fewer episodes of irritability and feel more calm and collected. I don't experience any of the physical symptoms of menopause like, hot flashes.
Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.
General anti aging effects on the face. Decrease in current facial lines and wrinkles and prevention of formation of new lines and wrinkles.
Neurontin coupled with a stimulant such as caffeine gave me a warm sense of well being and evenness.  However, the drug acted merely as a Novocaine to numb my depression and did nothing to help correct my brain chemistry.  That said, it was an effective enough band-aid that I suffered the sexual side effects in order to take it as prescribed.
It is supposed to lower the risk of breast cancer.  There was another abnormal mammogram & biopsy two years after starting it, but the biopsy was less abnormal. So no cancer is a benefit. There was NO improvement in bone density.
initially made it easier physically to stop smoking however still craving but know that smoking will not give me the same feeling or be as enjoyable due to the blocking of the nicotine receptors being blocked by the drug, so have not smoked.
reduced hot flashes; reduced heart palpitations
I took this medication to treat restless leg syndrome and it was very effective. It made me drowsy at first, but once I took it for a few weeks, it just made my legs stay still so I could sleep.  I was told it is the same medication prescribed for parkinsons patients, but at a much lower dose.  I did need to take a but more as time went on, but it was still effective.  Unfortunately, I had to stop taking it when I got pregnant, since it is a category c medication.
helped my anxiety, and overall mood.  I feel like I am less anxious and more calm.  I feel that my moods are more even.  I don't know what the long term effects are of taking this medication, though, and worry that I may get a stomach ulcer since I take over the counter pain relievers.
in a very short amount of time all of my anxiety was gone which was worth the side effects. my depression decreased as well.
I've suffered with pain for 11 years now.  I was on Loritab for those 11 years.  I was getting 120 10mg filled every 15 days.  They would kind of knock the edge off my body pain but I had a constant headache.  My Dr. recently prescribed me Tramadol.
Would bring down anxiety levels from an incapcitating point to a managable level on most occasions. Sometimes it could literally make the difference between being able to leave the house or not. Provided tremendous relief from the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of anxiety.





Worked very well as a sleep aid. Seldom experienced middle of the night waking.
Reduced asthma
it was IV push; it was  common to parents; it was accessible; dosage for pediatrics was easy to calculate. treated pts itching, swelling and hives.
The Skelaxin aided in my recovery from cervical disc surgery.  It eased muscle spasms and tightness in my neck, chest and arm.
acne vulgalis , oily skin and post inflamation hyperpigmentation.I know retinoid cmake skin younger and anti aging if I use every.afer I used 6 weeks.My oily skin is decrease.my acne is better.scar and comedones are resolve.Skin more smooth.Hyperpigmentation is decrease.
I was having difficulty controlling my temper, having loss of motivation, anxiety.  This helped to take the edge off so that I could function without the extreme mood swings.
I need to take this medication a few nights in a row which seems to get my sleep cycle back in sync.  After a few nights of sound sleep I can fall asleep quickly without the need for medication.  My mind is able to stop its endless racing/
The yeast stopped coming out in chunks, but was more watery like... Still yeast tho so I wasn't pleased...
Definite lowering of pain levels. Very gently, not like a pain pill. Several times I got off it, and about 48 hours later was in severe pain.
Patient was able to regain appropriate focus, improved ability in school.  Patient reported better communication skills with family and friends.
I really did not experience any benefits.
cured the hyperemesis I was suffering completely with no noticeable side effects.
less feeling of twirling...and more able to focus, and less distractability,more able to complete tasks and not flit from thing to thing
Meridia helps me stick to my diet without thinking about food all of the time.  It seems that this happens in two ways; first, I do feel full most of the time, even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating, feeling weak, full, ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural, like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also, I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack, I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something, so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  It is not a miracle drug.  I still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  Also, it took 1 and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  It did not help my hunger the first week.  Just give it some time to build up in your body!
The benefits were that the medication lessened the time and the severity I believe of the shingles outbreak.
Within 1 week of taking the cocktail of Abilify and Lexapro, a extremely unorganized person....became organized. I am now able to remember appointment times, keep up with my daily responsibilities...it has been a lifesaver
I felt the medicine only slightly cleared my acne.  I would say 30% clearer skin.
very upset
I had mono which went undiagnosed and that, along with other life stressors had me very sick and run down. I was diagnosed with Irritable bowel syndrome and suffered from severe nausea. I was unable to sleep or eat and began to lose weight. I had tried many anti-nauseants to no avail and began remeron as a last resort. My nausea all but disappeared. I only became nauseated when working nights. My anxiety level also somewhat decreased.
My mood was stablized, and I was able to take advantage of cognitive therapy.  Without the medication, I was not able to benefit from CT.
My historically "high moderate" or borderline high blood pressure (140/90 or 150/100) has been brought to normal (110/70 or 120/80) so that further, more aggressive treatment is unnecessary.
Antacids were ineefeective to counteract severe pain and inability to eat. Symptoms reduced within 24 hours and completely dissapeared within 3 days
helped to prevent flare by arresting inflammation at the beginning of condition. it was in a cream formulation which made it easy to penetrate skin and ideal for a tropical climate. it was however not useful when the condition- eczema or dermatitis flared up. it is more useful in controlling inflammation at the beginning as opposed to a strong steroid cream used more as a rescue when condition has already flared and has become red and angry.
This drug worked as a treatment for strep throat.
I was able to breathe more freely after I took this medication and my peak flow meter readings were significantly higher.
Muscle relaxation took about 2 days to be effective.  Pain reliever was effective in numbing the sensation initially, but after 2 days relief was found. 4 days was far better and 6-7 stopped taking every day.
Smoother and clearer skin, believe it may act as a Vitamin A derivative and promote faster cell turnover. My skin had less cystic boils and lesions, skin was less oily and seemed more resilient, but you have to be careful with the dose otherwise skin can become more sensitive, and sun block is recommended with this medication too.
Taken daily, Prevacid successfully reduced my acid stomach symptoms to the point that they did not occur. I did not need other over the counter remedies I had used in the past, such as anti-gas and antacid medications taken after symptoms appeared.
High concentration and staying focused.  It took away my irratibility & aggitation. I feel very calm. I felt that It help extremely with all my ADD symptoms except that I felt depressed. If that makes sense. Weight loss.
Helped with being able to feel more comfortable interacting in social settings.


Helped with being able to complete daily chores and activities. Also besides getting my daily chores accomplished I have more desire to attend social events and have picked up a few hobbies. Increased my overall since of happiness and positive outlook on life.
Helped with depression - did nothing for anxiety I did help me with my fear of crowds. It also helped me with my hopelessness I had been encountering.
HEART WORKS BETTER -NO PVCS- less shortness of breath able to do physical activities again
Nexium  is very effective for me when I want to relieve heartburn. I don't take it everyday, only when I have the symptoms of heartburn due to acid reflux.  The treatment benefits were that my stomach felt better, and I didn't have acid reflux due to the foods I had ingested.
I saw a moderate decrease of inflammation in some cystic acne lesions.  In the case of mild acne that is not cystic, the risks outweigh the benefits if the injection is not done properly.
I didn't receive any treatment benefits from this drug.  It actually made the symptoms worse with more resistance to antibiotics.  I ended up having to take a different, more powerful antibiotic.  I tried it two separate times with the same results both times.
Able to concentrate on school, work, movies and everything else that might go into a day. Able to become interested in hobbies and follow through with them.  People treated me differently.  The horses even treated me differently!  This medicine changed my life.  Gained the ability to remember things from conversations to classwork.
Niaspan definitely works to lower lpa.  I understand that high lpa cause plaque build up in the arteries.  According to my cardiologist, high levels of lpa cause "skinny people to have heart attacks".  My levels were in the 70's and the normal range ends at 30.  After taking Niaspan for a few weeks, my lpa was within normal limits.
Reduced excess acid and throat irritation, although not completely. Bending over still causes bile in throat.  Nighttime coughing still happens. Certain foods definitely trigger irritation.  Protonix was the last of 3 or 4 similar medications I tried (Nexium, etc) and all others had much worse side effects (headaches and dry mouth particularly).
I had fewer headaches and the headaches which I did have were less severe and easier to relieve with medication. I have fewer days off from work and can enjoy life with family and friends without worrying about headaches.
lowered blood sugar
Moderately dulled the pain of a collar bone injury.  Pain was still existent but I was so "dopey" that I didn't care.
Alleviation of post hysterectomy depression and other post menopause symptoms.
none
I'm not entirely sure it was effective at all.
Eliminated the pain without the mental side effects of drugs like Vicodin.
I noticed an accelerated skin cell turn over with the peeling and new skin coming through which is brighter and younger looking. With the combination of the Obagi skin care, my skin also became uniform in color overall and the darker or brown spots faded which helps to make my skin look even better.  I don't have much wrinkles to speak of except minimal ones around the eye area and laugh lines around the mouth which I did not notice any change or improvement on that.  Pimples after an initial phase of getting worst got better and during the monthly period is lesser than before treatment. Definite improvement on that!
Retin-A smoothed out my skin and reduced fine lines. It particularly helped the kind of lines that radiate from the corner of my eyes down my cheeks.  They virtually disappeared, and people remarked within a few months that I looked healthier, less tired, and younger.  I was happy with the results of using this product.
I did notice right away a marked improvement in my insomnia and no longer require the clonazepam.  I too felt a weight lifted off my shoulders and my disposition improved.  I felt much better than I had in years.  Little aches and pains in my lower back and hips which I've been treating throught the chiropractor, became more tolerable.  My husband was pleased and thinks I'm much easier to live with.  I didn't realize how grouchy and difficult I had become.
Breathing became easier.
decreased hot flashes
Treatment benefits were reduced anxiety caused by ringing in the ears sufficiently to allow rest and sleep.
the drug fluconazole was a quick and easy way to get systemic drug levels to fight skin fungus.
I couldn't stay on it long enought to know if there were any.
A very good nights sleep is one of the benefits, found out that the sedative effects are actually increased in the lower doses.  I lowered my dosage and live the sound sleep.  it knocked out my delusions and hallucinations, hopefully for good.
Even split pill severly reduced anxiety, made me feel more relaxed, took away physical feelings associated with anxiety like sweating and racing thoughts.  Made it easier to sleep.  Continued to work for 12 to 15 hours after taking. Took away mental stress and cleared my mind of all worries.
Face cleared up in weeks.About 3 mths. I started in the end of November and by mid February my face was extremely clear. I stop using it after my face cleared up, WRONG THING TO DO. Once your face has cleared you still need to continue using it so your face can remain clear.
It cured my tooth abscess, even though Ampicillin had failed to cure it.
This is supposed to thin the blood.  I don't know how you measure this.
Was effective in treating pain. That is all it was used for.
I took it when my husband of 30 years left me and my 4 kids for another woman.  I couldn't sleep, eat or function.  The klonopin helped me sleep, which helped me function. I probably would have committed suicide without it.
I am in my 5th week of treatment, and my liver enzymes did come down to normal, but I will see Dr. on 12th to find out if viral load came down.
It was suspose to help ease my depression issues that happend when the biploar side of me was not in hyper. It was a new drug it was suspose to be very effeect. Not cause any weight gain. With very little side effects.
Almost complete pain relief!  AMAZING!
I feel much better emotionally.  I was unable to get out of bed before I started treatment, and now I am back to having an interest in life.  It doesn't make me nauseous, which is a huge plus as far as I'm concerned.  I like that it doesn't cause weight gain or sexual side effects.


I was happy that it only made me feel mildly nauseous for a day or so.  I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile, but after a reduced my caffeine intake, that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day, but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep.
I really could not give any results as I had a severe reaction to the medicine. I broke out in a rash on my elbow to my wrist area and also swelling of my eyes one morning. That is when I stopped taking it approx. 4 days into it.
There was decrease in my acne and my skin became considerably smoother.
It did help to relieve my anxiety, but sometimes I had to take a full tablet rather than 1/2. It did enable me to ably cope with occasions where I otherwise would have been nervous wreck.  I can honestly say that it helped me.
Helped my depression considerably.  Also, out of all depression medication I have taken since 1994, I have been able to stop taking Wellbutrin the longest before depression symptoms returned, so I believe eventually I may be able to stop taking Wellbutrin and not have depression symptoms return.
The benefits were that the bumps under my skin did gradually get smaller and go away.  They stayed away as long as i continued to use the product.  An unexpected benefit was the my skin had a nice glow to it, like i had come from a facial and my skin was smoother, after using it for some time.
Restasis helps with tear related problems:  dryness, reflex overtearing, mucous discharge, irritated eyes, redness and lid swelling.  It can irritate at the initial time of therapy but with extra artificial tears this effect is lessoned.
Reduction of hot flashes and night sweats.
I chose to take vicodin instead of an ibuprofin based pain killer because my holistic doctor believes ibuprofin  slows healing time. For me, vicodin has literally no noticable side effects, of course I only took a limited amount for acute pain, which was relieved 100%.
lowered total blood cholesterol levels. In particular, my LDL (low cholesterol) was lowered significantly, while HDL (good cholesterol) was elevated.
I didn't feel the urge as much as I did before the medication, but they were still there.
NONE
Prometrium is a form of progesterone that helps ameliorate some common menopausal symptoms, including insomnia.
I go to sleep within an hour and a half of taking it. I even get up to use the toilet around 4 am and I have no problem falling back asleep. Tried Ambien for 6 months, but I had to keep upping the dose and I still couldn't sleep. Plus Ambien made my anxiety worse. Now my anxiety is gone and I am generally more content with life. "I can sweat the small stuff", if you know what I mean. I did start Prozac about the same time.
Less flair ups of the crohns disease. Less diarhea and cramping.
Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The "Old me" was back! 





Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them.
the benefits were, I was taking it for excessive prolong spotting and bleeding. Slowly but surely everything did go back to normal, no more excessive bleeding or spotting but it did take like 8 months.
Hair Regrowth
This drug has helped the pain and swelling in my hands and back from psoriatic arthritis. My fingers were also starting to twist, and this has helped to slow that down. The psoriasis on my skin has almost gone completely away. About a week or two before time for the next dose, a little comes back, but nothing like it used to be.
Maxalt relieved all the typical symptoms of a migraine within half an hour and i could keep going with my day where as before nothing would help. Topamax is my preventative but i still get the occasional that will push through and thats when i use the Maxalt, hence why only afew times a month.
Helped keep asthma under control.  Didn't cause side effects.  Was easy to administer.  Provided the outcomes we had hoped for.   Pleasant taste.
The upper and lower eyelashes grew longer, thicker, and darker.  There is less need for mascara or eyelash curlers with this product.  Lumigan contains the same active ingredient that Latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that Lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while Latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  It does work.
The retin-a seems to have minimized some of my fine lines, and has helped clear my pores, greatly reduced blackheads and minimized white-heads, and almost erradicated cystic blemishes altogether.  I believe the product does actually promote quick cell turnover based on the results I have seen thust far.
I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are "safe" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my "depressive" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel "normal" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.





I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds.
I feel that my skin is smoother, and hopefully the wrinkles will not get deeper as quickly as not doing anything.
It did control my periods.  Other benefits included a mild feeling of well being and return to health.
Cried less
Alleviated depression without lethargy, weight gain, a paradoxical effect, or sexual dysfunction.  Prozac made me suicidally depressed. MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me, except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  Wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression, and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- I went from smoking a pack of Camels a day to not smoking.
Protection aganst pregnancy. Some weight loss, less hungry. Less acne. No effect on sex drive.
Estradiol has almost completely eliminated the alternating cold chills and hot flashes that I was experiencing.  The full effect of the drug was derived within three days of beginning treatment with Estradiol.
Helped me concentrate, did help curb appetite, made me feel younger (more energy), thinking more clearly.
-night time sleep (at least 5-6 hours per night), more"peaceful" state of mind, no anxiety attacks, better brain function( no "brain fog" from insomnia), better concentration skills,
Pain reduction, increased mobility and range of motion.  The difference between how I feel with and without Mobic is astonishing.  Unfortunately, if I take this drug for more than six months straight, it begins to lose effectiveness.  Thus, I now save it for situations where I absolutely need it:  travel, sports, etc.
I had lighter periods and never felt the ring inside of me during intercourse or during my every day life.
It seems to keep my blood pressure and headaches in check, especially during hormonal changes right before my period begins.  I am also sleeping better at night (falling asleep and staying asleep; able to get back to sleep during the night), whereas before I was getting only a couple of hours of sleep a night.
Unfortunately this did nothing to heal the skin. It was an expensive experiment for the doctor to misdiagnose my condition, which was not sever but had been present for 9+ months. Eventually I was switched to fluocinonide, which seemed to do only a little better.
Reduced Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Allowed for greater concentraion on projects and tasks at hand.





Often before taking the medication I would just feel that it's impossible to get organized, to stick to the job at hand, or keep an appointment. Daily tasks of getting up and ready for the day's work, getting to work on time, and being productive at work were difficult.
Patient had a marked decrease in pain due to arthritis. Joint pain significantly decreased. Joint stiffness decreased a little. Overall, the drug is worth trying for arthritis pain and discomfort.
The drug did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It completely eliminated all nicotine cravings leaving only the psychological aspect to worry about.  So if I kept myself busy, the thought of smoking would never even enter my mind.
I did not need to take a pill everyday. There were less side effects compared to the amount in other birth controls. My painful cramps went away.
Severe pain in entire body was gone, and I mean GONE.  I felt like I was a little kid again, able to do anything.  I also had increased energy.
The treatment is to slow down or reverse to some degree of osteoporosis. no side affects from taking medicine.  have not had a bone scan to evaluate any change in my bone loss.
Some decent extra growth of hair, especially on the crown of the head. Ostensibly some on the front of the scalp, but hard to tell. Overall, it definitely has helped to preserve the hair I have (I have a twin brother who is effectively the control group, since he doesn't use such products, and he's getting pretty bald).
The pills regulated my menstrual cycle and reduced the occurance of cramps (so severe that I was often bed ridden). Other birth control pills that I had taken previously had undesirable side effects, such as weight gain, which I have not experienced with Levora.
Patient was more mellow and not as angry or argumentative. Also suicidal ideation went away. Patient was able to keep a job for longer than one year and not get fired due to bad attitude.
never had a heart attack. helps wit chest pain, and has a slight calming effect.i can workout more without increasing my heart rate too much

None.
none-i wanted to see some skin improvement of wrinkles but the side ffects of buning and redness were too severe to wait-not sure ahat else I can say here-i just discontinued the use-had to
My conclusions of the medication are that it has definately lessened the amount of migraine headaches that I was encountering. I have not had to have an emergency hospital visit in almost a year. This went from a visit occuring almost every other month with horrible painful headaches in between this time. I still get headaches which are tollerable, and if I have a migraine have not had to go to the hospital for pain relief. It has been tolerable. I have now gotten my dose down to 15mg at night time only and am still having the same benefit. My only side effect were some memory difficulty in the beginning. I drove to my doctors office and became disoriented. Rather than panic I laughed it off and pulled over and had to think about where I was going.


It has definately had a positive influence on the migraines. It seems to have some sort of effect on eating though. I did loose a bit more weight which I did not need to loose, but now have been able to be back at my normal weight.
Trazodone seems to help me to fall asleep faster and sleep longer. I had been having a hard time getting to sleep at night with insomia type effects. I would toss and turn and would have a hard time relaxing and would think about things that would make it hard for me to fall asleep. I started out at 200 mg, which would make me drozy in the mornings, and then changed to 100 mg which enabled me to get to sleep and not have such a side effect.
The pain went away and I could walk. my hip was mobile.

Taking hormone replacement therapy assisted me over the years to feel healthy and strong.  It replaced needed hormone to my body.
Reduced pain ability to move about with better ease and comfort.
The daily itchy throat and coughing spells have stopped.  I no longer have to carry cough drops with me for daily attacks.  I can now visit my children's homes who have cats and dogs.  Before taking this medication, cats caused sever asthma, itchy eyes, nasal congestion.  Taking a regimine of singular every day, prevents these symptoms upon interaction with cats.  Prior to taking singular, exposure to a home with dogs caused symptoms similar to flu..achiness, rhinitis, sneezing and runny nose.  After singular...symptom free.  My doctor advised that there is no risk in taking the medication long term, so I plan to continue its prophylactic effect.
This is a miracle drug. By day 3, the hot flashes stopped. I was able to sleep through the night again. The 2 month long headache disappeared. I have more energy and feel like my old self again. My brain function is much improved. No more dizziness, memory loss and the depression is gone. Also I have an increased libido and vaginal moisture returned.
At first, there was some minor improvement in the texture of my skin but then it began to degrade the area around my eye. The skin became thinner in appearance and more and more dry. It seemed to be harming my skin. At that point my dermotologist said my skin may be too sensitive. I do not feel that I have sensitive skin because while I may have a pale color skin, it has a olive tone. I do not sunburn very easily. Then I switched to ROC but had similar results.
First of all- no babies! So it's effective. It also slowed my periods a lot, i had heavy bleeding and severe cramping before, and now I have a 4 day period with cramping usually only on the first day. It has kept my skin SO clear, and it's almost too easy. Just mark your calendar for the third sunday after insertion, and that's when it comes out!
Once I started using the inhaler it greatly reduced night time waking with asthma symptoms. Early morning breathing became easier instead of tight breathing.  My use of a rescue inhaler specifically, Proventil, was cut down from several times a night to usually 0. I only use my rescue inhaler occassionally now instead of routinely.  My life has changed with Advair, I highly recommend it!
there were no benefits. This drug had more bad side effects than good ones.  I will never try this again. there were no benefits. This drug had more bad side effects than good ones.  I will never try this again.
Leveled out my affect, helped me sleep and wake up more refreshed, minimized angry or generally emotional outbursts with my children and husband.
The eye infection symptoms went away in about two days. My eye had been swollen shut. I had tried some over the counter with no results when I visited the doctor. He hesitated using it due to misuse from patients however my symptoms were so severe he made it happen for me.
The medication helped me with concentrating and it helped calm me down when i was feeling anxious.
Blood pressure was controlled with the same dose as the former drug I used, MiCARDIS. My insurance would not cover it and I started using fosinopril. I didnt think I had adverse effects from it until someone pointed out my dry constant cough.
Initial dose was highly effective for pain relief.  It took effect within 30 minutes and lasted several hours.
Clear headed, Able to complete projects without procastination, 100% help with short-term memory, lessened depression and anxiety, no more obsessive eating, weight loss...
relief of symptoms of Interstitial cystitis, including pain and frequency of urination
When I was first on the 20 mg dosage, there was no apparent benefit. When the dosage was upped to 40 mg, there was dramatic reductio of the edema. Then I had mitral valve surgery and took no Furosemide for a while, but eventually the edema returned and the 20 mg dosage helps some. (see side effects)
decreased chest inflammation
Taken each morning 30 minutes before eating, keep me from having any acid reflux.  One daily dosage worked for the entire day.  Even into the evening, if I ate spicy food or chocolate, I could go to bed without experiencing any heart burn.
Alleviated symptoms of clinical depression. Prior to treatment, experienced a severe episode of clinical depression that included acute symptoms such as insomnia, loss of apetite, loss of interest in life and people, suicidal ideation. After taking the drug for less than two weeks, I returned to a normal state of thinking, feeling, and functioning (which included alleviation of negative symptoms of depression and return to goal-oriented behavior and general sense of well-being.
The primary benefit was a reduction in acne. I would note that my acne returned several years later and I did a second course of Accutane. Since then my skin has been pretty clear (but I still have occasional breakouts).
helped with stopping hair falling out and keeping from being cold all the time.


also helped the feeling of being tired allthetime and gave more energy throughtout the day.  Did not feel as tired in the afternoon as before without it.
no benefit
Slight eurphoria and "high" felt good but not what I was trying to treat
Decreased number of spasms and pain associated with the spasms.
Had a pulled muscle in my leg, took Tylenol four times a day for two weeks along with ice twenty minutes four times a day for 4 days.  Pain and inflammation went away gradually over the two week period.  Took the Tylenol with food to protect the gastic lining of my stomach, also.  Now am back to running and jogging as before the injury.
cleared the condition completely.   Augmentin worked after other antibiotics did not.   The infection was resistant to other antibiotics.

I noticed that I was feeling better and my menstrual cycle was more regular. My skin cleared up as well and I felt more energetic.
Immediate ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.  No side effects in the morning.
Chantix was incredibly effective for the purpose of smoking cessation. While users are advised that initiative must be taken on their part to successfully quit smoking, I felt that the drug decreased the desire for nicotine so effectively, making smoking absolutely repellent, that a patient taking the drug would most likely quit without much active effort.
I have used this drug for several months. For me it lasts a long time, even into the next morning, BUT it seemed to take longer, on me anyway, than Viagra did, more like 2 hours before it worked at all. I would recommend this to anyone that does not need it to take effect quickly.
I am finally able to focus, concentrate on tasks, and able to stay on track at work. Before Vyvanse - I jumped from task to task without completing one prior to starting another.
Reduced blood pressure. Since takink telmisartan my blood pressure levels went down to normal. I could do my regular activities, including sports.
NO MORE HEART BURN OR ACID REFLUX
suppose to get rid of difittulitis which after colonoscophy I did not have. Took the drug for nothing. There were no benefits. The slight pain I had in the lower left side I still always have
taken at a stage where puss filled blisters were swollen, ensured a quick and painless transition from this stage to a stage where blisters became dry. Not much effect for 5 days or so, however when the blisters did dry up they did so quickly and was not painful at all which is what i had expected. fairly easy to apply and good consistency for application.
I was not willing to deal with the effects of the drug three times a day and so I discontinued use.
It did clear up the infection even in the time frame I used it.
increased ability to cope
This drug blocked the receptors for nicotine, so the cravings were extremely diminished. The dosage was increased over a week, so the physical withdrawal symptoms were decreased slowly.
greatly helps depression and mood. Very effective for obsessive thinking/ fear.   Stopped depression and there are very few anxieties.  Regained appetite.
I suffered chronic pain and sleep disruption because of the PN of unknown cause (not diabetes).  I also suffered mild depression because of the chronic pain.  Cymbalta began to relieve my symptoms almost immediately (and the depression as well.)  I still have pain,sometimes better,sometimes worse, but this drug in combination with others (see above) as well as consistent exercise has helped tremendously.
Reduction in Alopecia progression which began at age 21. Alopecia was very agressive through 20s until procecia introduction. Since then the condition has been slowed although not stopped.
The treatment benefits are to help lower blood pressure.  Blood pressure is being monitored by the physician and the patient.  So far, the benicar has shown to be as beneficial as the previous medicine patient has been on for the last seven years.  Since the pill is considerably larger than previous medicine I was on, I do have to chew the pill.
Treatment benefits include improved attention to task, improvement in work quality and quantity. Impulsivity was greatly reduced, resulting in a calmer more productive day. Social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. Social relationships with extended family members were also improved. As a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home.
Lexapro has proven to be a very effective antidepressant that is entirely lacking in sexual side-effects.
Decreased TSH Level from 428 to 1.5  Loss of hair slowed. Memory and depression improved. Body temp increased from 96 to 97.8  Energy level improved drastically. I could finally get though the day without having to nap fequently(4/5 naps of at least 20 to 30 mins) Brain fog lifted. Muscle aches and pains deminished. Skin was not as dry.
I had been having a pro-longed sleep deprivation problem, and was very fatigued and emotionally drained from it. I tried Tylenol PM but i read the negative effects on the liver from taking Tylenol frequently so I discontinued use. I finally went to the doctor to see what they might suggest, and after a consultation, i was prescribed Ambien. After trying it, I discovered that I would go out to sleep very deeply, and have vivid nightmares. I would wake up 3 to 4 hours later every night though, and only be able to go back to sleep very lightly. After a month of that, I gave it up. I ended up taking 5HTP for awhile with melatonin and now I sleep much better.
Once daily dose was more convenient than split doses of previous medication. The gradual release of the medication certainly reduced stomach and bowel problems (frequency and urgency of bowel movements) that had hampered activities beneficial to health such as hiking. The medication produced moderate control of my diabetes, though it is hard to judge what my blood sugar would have been without it
The benefits included mood elevation,obsessive thinking became less.  Anxiety and sleeping definately improved.
My father was put on this drug to fend off temporary, situational anxiety when his wife developed alzheimer's and was not looking after the finances properly.  It helped him to sleep better.  In the meantime, our family helped them sort out the financial mess his wife had created in her confusion.

It prevented pregnacy.
Strep symptoms subsided w/in 3 days. Reinfection did not occur. Family members did not catch the infection.

help me sleep better and makes me calm down when I'm depress
I was initially placed on this medication several years ago for RA when Vioxx was pulled.  I religiously self administered the medication for two years and then decided to quit because I didn't believe that it was helping much.  I took a "holiday" for 16 months and then checked in with my rheumatologist.  She suggested that I restart the medicine based upon x-rays and blood work.  I have been on it again for 3mos...I feel better...less pain..more energy.
I was able do my work without hassles and I'm free from pain right now. There's no need for me to cry anymore whenever I urinate.
The drug cleared the acne.  In addition, it peeled away old skin at the site.  I used it over small wrinkles and skin lines (without doctor's knowledge).  I was pleased with the results over small skin lines.  These dissapeared or diminished.  The product does not work over face parenthesis or deep wrinkles.  It appeared to me that skin's tone also improved.  The skin also developed a healthy shine.
Initially the treatment benefits were


-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain


- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)


- better mood (because of less pain)
While i take this drug, i feel very well, happy, I can concentrate in my activities. It helps me to make decisions, I can complete activities, i talk a lot, i stay in a good mood, but just while is during the effects.
The benefits of this treatment was slightly reduced pain due to a partial rotator cuff tear
Before I began taking the Mirapex, I was taking Clonapin which was very ineffective as I was constantly waking up in the middle of the night having to take more medication to get back to sleep. I had to get up and walk around until the medication took effect and I was exhausted all the time. On Mirapex,  I am able to sleep at night without being awakened by my restless legs which is a huge relief for me and my husband.
I believe that the Premearin allowed normal vaginal secretions and


somewhat emotional stability.  During the time I was using the Premarin I had


decreased hot flashes/sweats that, I presumed was a result of the drug, although the hot flashes are much more infrequent now that I'm using the natural progesterone cream.
Reduced stickiness of the blood.If inflammation of blood vessels did occur, the blood was thinner and so could get through vessels with reduced occurence of ulceration. General overall improval of condition.
Noticed a difference in a month
NONE!!!
When I feel or see the signs of a cold sore coming, I take the valtrex and it is gone without a trace within 24 hours.
Hair maintainance. Without finasteried or dutasteride patient experienced prickly heat on scalp. With treament, the prickly heat stopped. Had previously taken finasteride and hair had regrown to some extent.
My therapist prescribe this cream, as I develpe dark sport on my skin on the back  from exema. The sport were itchy so I couldn't sleep well and they turned dark due to post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation.


I am still using the cream but it effectively eliminated any itching and dark sport  reduce in size and became lighter.


In fact, my therapist later prescribed a more potent cream, betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%, but I felt that the first one was more effective in my case.
reduced inflammation, hence, their enzymes are targets of current anti-inflammatory therapies. Products of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenases (LO) types I and II display both beneficial roles, such as lipoxins (LXs) that stereoselectively signal counterregulation
Able to breathe in a relaxed way without forcing the breath and without wheezing. Asthma "controlled" meaning ventolin used hardly at all (after decades of relying on it).
Clearup of infection and regrowth of nails
Bystolic.significant lowering of dyastolic, systolic pressures and pulse rate..lower anxiety levels


Niaspan..over period of one year, lowered LDL cholesterol levels by 100 points
The Premarin did reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats.  From that perspective, the drug was somewhat effective.  However, the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  It took me two years to discern that the problems I encountered were attributable directly to the Premarin.
I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  It helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  However it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then I just feel relaxed.
The benefits were to relieve anxiety and to calm me down so I don't lose control and freak myself out. Also to control my heart palpatations when I become nervous.
The once daily treatment was effective in keeping me from having moderate acne breakouts while I was taking hormone replacement therapy.  I also used testosterone cream (compounded) and my doctor felt that this was the source of the acne and also some water retention.
I got longer, darker and thicker eyelashes. These were noticeable after about 6 weeks. Thereafter they continued to grow for a few months till they reached a maximum. Then I carried on with maintenance doses.
diminished inflammation, noticeable loss of swelling, pain relief, did not have to take it orally-I applied it as needed on affected knee. It has worked on other joints too (hands, hips, etc..)
I have experienced an very noticable decrease in hairloss or progression of male pattern baldness after I started using this product.  It was advised to me by a physician friend.  It's basicaly the same product as Propesia which are being sold as an chosmetic product at half the dosage and for double the price.  I have noticed a severe reduction in hairloss and have actualy grown some hair back.
there were no benefits. i had severe side effects. . the medication helped the headaches for a short amount of time but the side effects outweighed the benefits. i call it the stupid medicine because i literally turned stupid after using it.
I have already given this information.xxxxxx The term arthritis means �joint inflammation.� Some people refer to arthritis as �joint pain.� There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. The 2 most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Oh my gosh I am in heaven I have suffered with restless legs for 20 years reallyA little nauseau when I first started bad. I was up walking the floor every nite at least 5 to 10 times a nite.  To me it is a miracle.  I have not had any restless legs since I started.
I enjoyed life again and felt happiness, I could hold down a job and look after my family. I was no longer suicidal. I lost weight because most of the time I was no longer depresses. and My overall health improved
Yasmin is an excellent birth control pill.  Not only does it prevent pregnancy, but it decreases bloating, irritability, and monthly blood lost.  There is decreased break through bleeding and cramps as well.  It just became available in a generic, so bringing the cost much lower.
The drug after an about an hour went into affect.  I had more energy and felt the desire to "do things."  During the day I did not think about food, and had no desire to eat.  I felt good and didn't care about eating.  It left you with a feeling of being happier too.
The headaches are well controlled on this drug, sometimes for as long as 72 hours. However, the effects of the rug were shorter lived during hormonal migraines
lessening of fungus
For the first two weeks I did not feel absolutely anything. Then, after about 15 days, I began to feel different. My constant sense of fear and worry was replaced by a sudden feeling of self-confidence. My depression, which formerly kept me in a state of perpetual sorrow, self-pity and doubt, was lifted from me like a veil. Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real. I loved the miraculous effects of this medication. Unfortunately I was forced to stop taking Paxil because of negative side effects.
the low dosage of Lisinopril reduced my blood pressure from 138/96 to 127/90.
Having been diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was only twenty, I was administered varying levels of Synthroid.  Prior to taking the medication, my hypothyroid condition was so severe that my metabolism was adversely affected.  Not only did I feel sluggish, but my liver was even slow to act because I started turning orange! My fingertips were calloused, my speech was slurred and my hair had begun falling out.  When the first dosage was given, it was too high.  Then when it was adjusted and my blood levels determined that it was the right amount, the symptoms all began to subside and slowly I became functional again.  I don't normally take any over-the-counter medications but as for this prescription medication, I need it to effectively manage my hypothyroidism.
None
lessened the frequency of asthma attacks particularly during a chest cold and generally day to day.
None because I had to stop taking it due to the side effects.
None
Treatment provided the patient with the ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the entire night
I was suffering from migraine headaches for more than 40 years, since a teenager. Topamax has reduced twice weekly migraine headaches to approx. 3 or 4 times a year for severe migraines, although I still suffer from chronic, but infinitely much easier to bear, daily headache. I am thankful for the use of this (originally) anti-seizure drug for migraine prevention.
decreased pain and inflamation, need no other pain medication for arthritis pain, have bee taking motrin for eight years with good results and little side effects other than mild nausea when taken without food.
The medication helped to reduce the headache pain if not eliminate it completely.  I was getting a headache almost dailey. It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it.
the excruciating, shooting nerve pain in my left leg stopped after about a week although I could still feel that the nortriptyline just masked the pain ie. In the past 6 months I have got down to 12.5 mg per day although a recurrence of the terrible shooting pain (after 2 years) had made me decide to try Gabapentin instead- my doc recommends this
Completely cleared up mild to moderate acne on face, neck, shoulders, back, and arms and should continue to stay clear for some length of time.

Started taking this drug for two reasons - peri-menopausal symptoms (mood swings) and depression experienced after going through hurricane Katrina. After 2-3 weeks of starting, noticed my temperament was much more even and felt better able to cope with daily stress and stay motivated.
I was prescribed the drug Mercaptopurine after two previous treatment drugs had begun to prove less effective than before.  The doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently 100mg (2 pills) every evening.  There was a significant reduction in Crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  This was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as I was relaxing to go to sleep.
clear head - sometimes / less allergy - sometimes
improved skin texture and tone
Significantly improved leg pain and allowed my child to use the leg and get stonger. Kept her from returning to narcotics. She was able to continue physical therapy and resume school. This site insists I write 50 words in this block, but I have covered all the relevant information. I just wanted people to know that once you adjust to this medicine it was a big help for my child's leg pain. I hope this is enough words.
Reduces sinus congestion significantly. Made sleep easier.
Considerable weight loss, increased energy, decreased appetite,
Very few side effects and no baby.  I started taking the pill because I wouldn't stop bleeding after having my daughter.  My doctor prescribed another type of pill and it stopped it immediately.  So after my next appointment, I told him I wanted something more permanent and seasonique was the answer.
It cleared the ear infection completely.  It offered me assurance that the infection did not progress to brain.
Improved appearance of skin (improvement of imperfections, reduced pore size, more even complexion, increased glow) and improved texture of skin (smoother and softer). Others have complimented me a lot on my appearance recently.
I quit smoking, minimized desire to drink alcohol, suppressed appetite, stabilized mood fluctuations.
I did not contract malaria and I also noticed some increase in the clarity of my skin.
On the fist day I experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath but the drug seemed to take affect the next day. When I took the drug on the second day I expereinced an increased heartrate and other symptoms such as the ones I listed above.
visible reduction in the infection was noted at approx 4 days.  It was a good alternative to having a surgical procedure and the required "down time" associated with a surgical procedure.
helped relieve the allegy symptoms for a part of the day
i cant list very many benefits because my expierience was so bad that i would rather have been dead than have been forced to have taken this pill every day for 3 to 4 years
Ziana minimized the large sore pimples.  I continued to have a few during my menstrual cycle. However, I continued to experience blocked pores / blackheads and very oily skin.  The product did not appear to help this.
After starting on a diuretic and a beta blocker without significant results, adding the ACE inhibitor worked wonders, and has continued to do so for 27 years. The next step, if one becomes necessary will be to add a sartan. Based on my previous response. I expect it to be a happy experience.
noticed a significant improvement in exercise induced asthma/shortness of breath. Also I previously had a chronic cough/throat irritation prior to taking singulair and this is now gone. My asthma would act up when I drink or eat cold foods and this is no longer a problem. I haven't had bronchitis in over a year and would usually get 3-4 x  year.
at initial dose of 25MG felt effects very quickly.  Titrated up to 100MG/day and slowly noticed it losing its "punch". Initially felt much better - motivation increased dramatically.  Finally felt normal, and in combination with Trazodone slept very well for the first time in years.
It took at least 3 days of treatment for me to begin feeling better. On day 6, the ear and throat feel better.  However, I have tickling in my chest and lots of coughing that was not initially the problem.
Since beginning treatment with Evista, I have had three DEXA scans, and my bone density has remained stable.  I have had no broken bones or spinal fractures during this period, and I have heighth has remained the same.
lowered total cholesterol by 40 points
I went to therapy and asked about ADD meds, I took a test showing attention and memory lapses. Doc gave me 60 mg, my grades improved dramatically, which was specifically the result I wanted. Furthermore, I got far more done outside of school, coincidentally.
After taking Aciphex for 1 week, my heartburn symptoms went completely away.
This drug was most effective in 'cooling' my anxiety.  The depression was less affected, but definately improved.  I felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  I wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time.
It did clear up my inner ear water. It also seemed to dry up the constant mucus that seemed to be in my sinuses. This helped me to be able to breathe better.
I did not notice any benefits in terms of decrease of pain or inflammation in the affected site.  I've found fish oil and curcumin to be far more effective with fewer side effects.
The single dose was easy to take, and the drug got rid of any other fungal infections in my body that may have contributed to the vaginal yeast infection.
The medication does seem to help with joint inflammation.  I find no real benefit for headaches or body aches.  There are some studies that show this drug may be beneficial for the treatment of polyps in the large intestine which may be a benefit for me in the long run.
My attention span was incrementally increased, as was the intensity of my focus. Also, while taking the drug, I noted a significant decrease in my appetite, which subsequently induced a fair amount of weight loss.
My fingernails have grown back to where the nail hits the end of where it should be instead of clipped down. I cant wait for the nail to grow  back all the way to where I can pick up a piece of thin paper with my fingernail, as I work at an office!.Also, the little black splinters under my thumb nail are starting to go away, as is the yellowing and thickness of the nail, due to the infection.
DECREASED REDNESS
There were few benefits.  It still took me a long time to go to sleep, about two hours.  Some nights it didn't work at all.  When dosage was increased the side effects became unacceptable.  I took the medication for a week and then could not stand it anymore.  It was preferable to go without sleep than to take this drug.
I had no benefits.  It didn't seem to make anything better at the time.  It seemed the depression was still the same and then I had side effects that affected me daily.
Less pimples, increased smoothness of skin
considerably reduced pain, if i experienced any at all.
Since no such infection (i.e. endocarditis) ever occured after a dental procedure, the logical conclusion is that it was successful as an antidotal/ antibacterial treatment against (i.e.) endocarditis. However, I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years, also with no post-procedural infections.
Retin A Micro has lessened any uneven skin pigmentation.  Retin A Micro has minimized the size of my pores.  Retin A Micro has minimized wrinkling in my skin.
Prozac helped in toning donwn my depression. Prozac was effective for the first 5 years then my depression slowly started to become worse. I then had to be placed on Wellbutrin for about 2 years, along with Prozac and yet my side effects from Prozac increassed to the point where I was taken off prozac.
It allowed me to focus on what I was learning, ie, in class work that I may have stopped attending to otherwise, or would have bluted out something "inappropriat" without thinking it through before I spoke.


It also allowed me to continue to pay attention and focus on a subject that I have no interest in but must understand and learn, ie, math.
It did lower my blood presure, but the 25mg dose that I was taking was too strong for me.
if taken within the first hour of of your personal migraine symtoms the med. works very well. usually within an hour you can control the nausea and light sensitivity with only a little sleepiness.it only takes about 30 to 60 minutes to take effect so if you catch it early you can forego almost all your pain.
I was originally prescribed 20 mg, but the rating was creeping up again, so the dosage was doubled. As I only took it for 2 weeks, cannot be sure of effectiveness
Considered beneficial for post menapausal women to prevent the recurrance of breast cancer.  It is a hormone blocker that stops the production of estrogen.  Many breast cancer tumors are estrogen positive and thrive in the presence of estrogen.
After starting treatment with Cipro, I almost immediate improvement of my condition, and the pain was severely lessened.
Helped with condition of skin around the eyes, mouth and between the eyes. They did appear less noticable. The brown spots were greatly improved, lighter, less noticable
I could completelly leave the corticosteroids and didn't feel the pain and inflamation except for some special periods of stress. Consequently I got a better quality of life.
Ive only been on Topamax for two weeks and only have had 1 migraine which is good for me. I use to have about 3 to 4 migraines in a matter of two weeks.
Fewer allergies and sinus headaches.
Hoping that contuined use will imporve my age spots and skin firmness.
Overall cholesterol dropped from 270 to 180. HDL went up, LDL went down to optimal ratios. My cholesterol numbers changed very quickly, within little over a month. Obviously, it's a very effective drug for me.
The only treatmenet benefits were the prevention of pregnancy and the near elimination of a monthly menstrual cycle --including the elimination of painful cramping during the monthly cyle.  The benefits at the time I was taking this medication outweighed the risks/side effects, but now the risks/side effects outweigh the benefits.
prevented mania and panic experienced with mania
Very good pain relief and muscle relaxation.  Great for alleviating pain from an especially bad headache but also works good as an adjunct for musculoskeletal pain.
The objective of Tamoxifen is to work against the effects of estrogen on cancer cells. As a treatment for breast cancer, the drug is supposed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that are present in the body. I am praying that this is fulfilling its purpose but only in 3rd month of taking it so who knows.
Ability to have benefits of birth control in the convenience of a ring, that allows freedom from worrying about taking a pill and an unwanted pregnancy.
Allowed me to fall asleep and stay asleep for the first week.
Wanting to be drug free, I weened myself off of the Wellbutrin, but found that I could not happily function without the Lexapro.  When I tried to lower (self medicate) the dosage, my racing and repeating thoughts came back really strong.  I started counting again, repeating sentences in my head, singing song verses over and over in my head, replaying conversations over in my head, etc.  Being back on the 20mg keeps me feeling normal and only in very stressful situations do I start obsessing/repeating.
Moderate seizure control, seizures controlled during the awake hours, however, still uncontrolled during sleep.  Patient has multiple, short seizures, nightly.
Methotrexate significantly reduced my daughter's arthritis symptoms, allowing her to resume a normal, active life without joint pain.  After being treated with this drug, she has remained symptom free for several years now.  She did not have to progress to more expensive arthritis drugs since she responded well to methotrexate.
The treatment benefits are that it has stopped  the acid from coming up into my esphogus.  I also has benefited from further damage to my esphogus from the acid reflux. I do not have bad breath from the acid and i am no longer horse in my throat when i talk alot. The nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid.
none - ended up in emergency room
There was a persistent area of blister like bumps on lower face similar to acne but without resolution.  With this treatment, the bumps disappeared and didn't return for one year.
Slight alleviation of PHN pain.
I did get relief from the hot flashes and this did contribute to a good nights sleep. I had a hystirectomy a year before I was put on the hormones. I say an increase in wrinkles in that first year. I can not say that I have seen a slowing in the aging process but I am sleeping better and that of course will bennefit the skin.
the cream did reduce fine lines but my skin peeled first so I only usie it oc.casionally now. I would use it, the skin would peel and the lines are slightly reduced. It also dries up blemishes
Wellbutrin XL made a real difference in my life.  I had a tendency to get unnerved and anxious at the smallest things and since taking Wellbutrin, my husband has noticed a huge difference in my disposition.  I was not a majorly depressed person, just mildly depressed and fatigued, and also becoming uninterested in activities that I used to enjoy.  Wellbutrin definitely made me feel happier and more interested in life. As far as the rumor goes of Wellbutrin enhancing sexual desire - I have not noticed a diffence in myself in that regard.
Meloxicam was prescribed after Vioxx was taken off the market.  It has been beneficial in relieving the pain from a pinched nerve.  (The pain goes from the left side of my forehead, down my face, my neck, my shoulder, and my left arm).  I sometimes wonder if I really need it, so occasionally I stop taking it, but within 3 to 4 days, the pain comes back full force, so I know it is effective.  It is slightly less effective than Vioxx.
Hot flashes are not as often and not so intense.The patch is very easy to use. I can not tell I'm wearing one. I no longer have night sweats. Going to work is a lot easier, my head is not constantly on fire!
allowed maintained remission of ulcerative colitis for up to five years.  did experience some flare ups, but they were short lived and the exception to years of complete remission
My blood tests indicated that I had high cholesterol.  I started taking this soon after, and approx. one month into taking this product, my cholesterol numbers have dramatically decreased.  My physician attributes this to lipitor as well as diet and exercise.  I have not experienced any side effects.
It decreased my wheeze after about 5days. The wheeze became intermittent from then but did not go away and after 2days of not taking prednisone the symptoms returned, not as bad as they originally were though. Am now on so had another course of prednisone.
Controlled acne very well when taken continuously.  Eliminated PMS symptoms.  Prevented pregnancy.  Experienced minimal monthly bleeding.
Lifting of mood.
It really evened my mood. I was not irritable at all.
Allowed to drive again after build up to therapeudic level
stopped the heartburn
Very little benefits, may have had a slight lessening of pain but not much
I began taking this drug one year ago, and within a few days I was heartburn free. I take it once daily before breakfast.
the benefits weren't noticed per needed. I couldn't tell if the back spine was stronger as I felt the same.
No side effects and the crying went away. It really helped me when nothing else did.
This is a miracle drug for me, got rid of vaginal dryness, and even got rid of hot flashes, even though the estrogen dose is so low!  Would recommend to anybody.
Well, I never had sex without a condom, so I wouldn't really know. But, I guess it would be okay. not many people seem to have many problems with it.
Clobex was effective in resolving minor contact dermatitis. It soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. Use continued for six months with no results. The rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of MRSA was made. The Clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. Use was discontinued and Bactroban and Septra DS was highly effective at clearing the infection. Have since had no need for Clobex and have used alternate methods for any incidental dermatitis that may occur. For those who chose to traditional medications, I can recommend Clobex for mild to severe dermatitis. I was satisfied with the results, except for the misdiagnosis of Skin MRSA, yet glad to know from experience, the difference between these two rashes.
some of the lighter spots lightened slightly but the darker spots did not really fade, in fact it seemed like they got a little darker
Major decrease in joint pain , major increase in mobility. Everything else improved as well; my energy, ability to do everyday small tasks, my state of mind, and sleeping. I had always been a very active person. After starting the Enbrel, I could  jog again, ride horses, bike, play tennis, etc.
Keeping me from the effects of menopause.
Able to curb appetite; lose weight effectively for the 1st two week; feeling energetic at the initial stage
No benefits in 2 months, no reduction in body hair
fast weight loss and increase energy
Lumigan worked fairly well regulating eye pressure for over five years, however less effectively in the past year. A second drug was added (Timilol)to further reduce eye pressure.  Lumigan taken p.m. Timilol taken a.m.
the medication kept my asthma under control or so i thought.    as an aside, i still have a few left and every so often if i am out of my migraine medication, i will take a theodur and it seems to alleviate the headache.  it was inexpensive.
Decreased depression. Decreased anxiety with heart palpatations.
The medication works very well in conjunction with the Quinadine Gluconate to help calm the extra heart beats.  I started on the medication when I was 19 and am still on it today at age 50.  I've tried other new drugs but always seem to come back to this tried and true one.
I felt calmer and my overall outlook was better. It was subtle...still had some nerve problems and anxiety, but my guess is thats because it does not erase problems...but you can tolerate them better over the long haul.
Prevented pregnancy, acne was lighter, predictable periods
There was a huge reduction in the number of migraine headaches that I experienced.  Before I started on the meds, I was getting migraines 3-4 times per week.  Now I get them once or twice a year.  I think the daily meds may even slightly reduce the rate at which a migraine (the rare times that I get them now) comes on.
It clears the infection in the sinus and lower respiratory tract.  I was coughing badly due to irritation from mucus formed by post nasal drip down the throat.  The phlegm was yellow in colour.
completely stopped all heartburn.  do occassionally have an acidic taste in my mouth in the morning, so I suspect that there may be a small amount of reflux still occurring.
Most of the adverse acid reflex symptoms went away after several months of taking the drug. After a full course of treatment, I would only get hearburn and hunge pains if I would abuse the acid triggering foods.
i did not observe cholesterol lowering although Your doctor may decide that, along with diet and exercise, VYTORIN is right for you. If so, remember to take 1 pill a day in the evening, as your doctor prescribes. Take VYTORIN with or without food�the choice is yours.





VYTORIN is a tablet containing two medicines: Zetia� (ezetimibe) and Zocor (simvastatin). VYTORIN was clinically proven to lower bad cholesterol more than Lipitor or Zocor alone.
I used to have a serious acne problems starting from age 14, at 16 I started to see a skin specialist.   After a month of taking this medication I saw a good result, my acne started to clear off within 2 months there were minimal acne, after 4 months no more acne, (just occasionally one or two popped up)  It worked well on by drying up my oil glands so my face were less oily and it helped fixing up my scars as well.
For awhile it did prevent cold sores. Then I started having frequent chest pains as well as fainting spells. Now I'm finding out from an ER Physician and the Pharmacist I 1. should never have been prescribed this dosage (twice what should be prescribed in per day) and NO-ONE should take Acyclovir for this length of time either. I've been told this is the reason for my fainting spells, chest pain, low blood pressure problems, increased kidney (renal) damage, yeast infections and most recently a series of fungal infections.
not having to worry about taking a pill every day, but simply putting it in forgetting about it for 3 weeks and then take it out and be without for a week.  simply doesn't get any easier than that.
Permanently: cured of cystic acne.  Temporarily:  eliminated blackheads, smoothed skin texture, skin appeared "poreless".
Peace of mind that I am doing something to decrease the MS progression.
Mild anti-depressive effect and general sense of well-being. Mild increase in energy and productiveness, easier time staying on task and focusing, directing energy and finishing tasks. More motivated
Nearly complete control of bipolar condition, except in times of stress. It worked very well for me, even though I tried almost all the SSRIs over the years.
Since the tumor was estogen receptor positive, the treatment has resulted in any remaining canncer cells to be in remision.   


The side effects were mild enough that regular activities were not interfered with for the most part.  


It was a better alternative for me than Taxol chemotherapy which had severe side-effects for me.
as soon as I took my first dose, as long as it was during the pre-sore/tingling stage, and continued to my second dose .... my cold sore never really appeared.





Or, if my coldsore had already started ... and I took my valtrex, the "blister" would not get any larger and would go away in half the time if I wasn't taking this medication
Did well to get rid og the skin cancer
keeps me alive during flare-ups!  (They incl pericarditis & pleural effusions, ie inflammation of the lining around the heart and lungs � involving LOTS of fluid for which there isn't space, leading to heart failure and breathlessness - nice...) I can more or less live a normal life, apart from at the start of a flare (and spending hours researching online!).
the infection and subsequent pain lessened, though did not disappear completely
The treatment benefits were considerable as OxyContin reduced my pain considerably. In the beginning I was advized to take the drug 1 hour before the previous one wore off as it can take up to 1 hour for it to work. The pain however always did go away and therefore relieving me of it and making me feel comfortable again.
it was a very strong pain killer.
Lexapro immediately reduced my propensity for negative thoughts (e.g., "I'm not worthy" / "everything sucks"). It was almost as if thinking negatively became impossible. Consequently, panic attacks and depression diminished greatly.





The drug also made me feel overall less tired (I was previously feeling tired all the time). Consequently, my sleeping pattern normalized.
- Very light periods


- Very predictable periods


- Very short periods


- No PMS
Sleep very well, at least 8 hours unless something wakes me up. Hiatus hernia not there on last endoscopy. major digestion problems gone. some slight acid reflux/indidgestion if eating big/heavy/rich meal. otherwise excellent.


Not happy with side effects if miss dose or try to come off-very dizzy, sick, hallucinating etc. so have to take without fail before bed every night.
patient slept better


patient had some decrease in pain
Stabilized my anxiety during a difficult relationship and grief over loss of opportunity to be a mother. Allowed me to keep working and stay in relationship without major breakdown. Prevented me from developing panic attacks and developing major depression
Positive- increased libido
concentration and anxiety levels returned to normal were very good. Felt so much better on the medication. Really noticeable quite quickly the benefits.
No.  They were harmful to me.
I was able to do normal daily activities again
Only moderate improvements noted on the 5g dosage.    


Improvements much more noticeable at 10g - or after 30 days of taking medication.   Less confusion, more awareness in social surroundings, more outward and positive in attitude.
I was able to sleep
i dont think i felt anything positive, no mood change, just the same really although i am smoking a lot less, it does a good job of taking away cravings for nicotine
The drug dissolved the clots over time and the pain and swelling  mainly subsided unless I was on my feet standing in one place for a long period of time.
My headaches were not as severe as they were before I started the medication but I still had headaches, just not as many and not as severe.
relief of pain
More often than not, I was able to sleep for 3-4 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
Severe case of eczyma which cleared almost immediately after starting zyrtec
none
It took a while since the dose increases so slowly, but I started to realize that I wasn't reacting so severly to my daily emotional changes. If I was upset about something, I wasn't experiencing the sever mood swings I normally would. My frustration and anger no longer controlled me. A general sense of being able to handle my negative emotions without falling apart. My family noticed a big difference.
After a rotater cuff injury three years ago i was given mobic for pain and aching that was interfering with sleep. Mobic decreased the pain considerably.  I did not have pain or discomfort from the arthritis. i was just told i had some arthritic changes.
Amazing results with minimal side effects.  I suffered from severe headaches for years before finally consulting with a neurologist.  Imitrex was life changing because I no longer worried about getting a migraine, which in turn reduced the number I was getting!
I fastly recovered from the virus and felt much better after the second administration of the drug.
The benefits were remarkable and fast.  Before taking the mirapex, the patient got very little sleep and consequently was irritable.  After taking the mirapex, the restless legs calmed down immediately.  The patient can now go to a movie, take a trip in a car and sleep with a reasonable amount of comfort.  The restless legs are not totally cured, but it is manageable now.  Even working 8 hours a day is much more manageable.
Craving reduced.  Smoked first week and two days of second week.  Find I don't think about having a smoke when first get up or right after eating all the time.  But I still do have cravings at times.  The cravings are manageable.
Much reduced occurrence of papules and pustules.


Increased healing time and generally results in a clearer skin.





The combination of topical benzoyl peroxide with oral doxycycline seem to synergistic reducing the severity of acne.
Birth Control
made me feel normal
helped decrease reactions to common allergens. I have hay fever every spring and Zyrtec helped with the common symptoms of hay fever. Helped decrease sneezing, runny nose and decreased reactivity to allergens experienced during the spring season when my allergies are the worst.
regulate sleep
There was an improvement in the healing time for acne
Effective in helping to control acid reflux
Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which, if you have ms this is what you aim for.
very little benefit, slept a bit better, still got anxiety, cant always sleep, offered valium as well for bad days, good days are wonderful, stressful time isnt over yet so body still goes into panic
BMI was 36 before I started Meridia.  After 4 monhts, BMI is 28.  Lost 43 pounds.  Increased energy and confidence.  Another benefit was an increase in alertness and confidence.  I had low blood pressure and was quite passive before, and with the medication felt an increase in energy and heart rate.  My behaviour changed - I became more assertive because I was more impatient than before.
I took Tamiflu as soon as I knew I had contracted Swine Flu.  While it did not stop the flu in its tracks I did not get seriously ill and my recovery time was quite short.  Somo of my friends also contracted Swine Flu and did not take Tamiflu.  Two of them became very ill and it was several weeks before they coudl go back to work.  Their general energy levevls were low for about 2 months.  By contrast, I was never really bed bound and was out and about after about one week.  I did not experience any longer term effects.
improved vaginal lubrication, decreased sensitivity, improved urinary continence, improved urethral tone,
None. When I was last encountering depression 10 years ago, my Doctor gave me some round green pills whose name I can't rememeber. They worked well, helping numb my depression as I sorted out my life. After recent suicidal feelings regarding a reactive depression to losing my job, my GP prescribed me Citalopram. I just wanted something to numb me again as things got better(which they did) but these tablets nearly sent me crazy.
Allergic reactions stopped almost immediately
it seemed to begin clearing up my sinuses but stopped taking it because of side effects after 2 days
helped me to fall asleep quickly
Initially did help with sleep. Over time tolerance developed and depression and grogginess ensued.
Generally, Lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying). The mood difference is noticeable. My pscychiatrist prescribed Lamictal to me because, as a mood stabilizer, Lamictal is often used to treat resistant depression. Considering that I had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression, this was an appropriate choice.
none, I was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. I had no energy.
My heart burn was relieved within forty eight hours and continued for the length of the treatment.  I was very satisfied with the results.
happier, slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well, I thought, as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all, I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation, which contributed to depression, low energy, and anxiety. I felt cured
Stratterra enabled me to concentrate and focus on tasks at hand.  It makes a world of difference in my daily life.  After four years of using Stratterra, I would never switch to a different ADHD medication.
The leg clot would not extend nor would other clots form, potentially causing death.
Improved my quality of life and was able to maintain a job for longer period of time. I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school, work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to!
It cleared up my nasal allergies, opened up my nasal passages and stopped post nasal drip.
improved... focus, concentration, memory, organization, timeliness, mood, patience. Improved ability to attend to unpleasant tasks.
Having suffered with depression/anxiety after the break up of my marriage, during which I lost a huge amount of weight, couldn't sleep, was agitated, tearful etc etc. the fluoxetine initially helped me relax and gave me a 'holiday from myself'.  The effects totally calmed me, enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.  I regained my weight and although not totally free from the fluoxetine, have now cut down to every other day and have now been able to resume working.  My experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings.
Lost 15 pounds and did not feel hungry while taking the medicine. On days that I forgot to take a capsule, I did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet.
Insomnia, night sweats and hot flashes stopped with in 72 hours.


Mood has stabilized, memory has improved and I am feeling more focused. libido has returned and Skin feels better.
Ritalin made me get up. For the first time I wanted to work. It gave me the good sensation that I  could do things. I worked and worked like a bee. Therefor, depression was a thing of the past when I take this medication. It help my mind to focus and stay sharp.  I can concentrate better with this medication.
Produced mature follicles for iui cycle.
I had taken this medication, Cipro, as prescribed by my general practicioner to treat a strep throat infection.  The first time I used this medication, it was very effective with no side effects and after 3 days


of taking it, I noticed considerable improvement and then by the time the perscription was totally consumed, probably 10 days worth, the Strep throat was gone and all cleared up.  It was the second occasion of treating a similar illness that the side effects were detected.
I didn't have any symptoms, so I don't feel any better or any worse after being on Crestor. My cholesterol has always been high during routine blood tests but around a year ago it had risen to 8 mmol/l (almost 300 ml/dl)and my HDL/LDL ratio was poor. Trigylserides were normal before taking Crestor after weight loss.
none
None.  It didn't help me sleep.  I was cranky the next day, depressed, and tired.
general gradual lowering of cholesterol levels over a period of twelve months
I never got pimples, pustules, or anything else associated with this condition.  But maybe I never would have--it is hard to say.





The first dermatologist to prescribe it wanted to put me on several weeks of antibiotics.  I really did not want the systemic side effects of that.  Also, I oppose the overuse of antibiotics because it leads to resistant bacteria.  So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics.
none whatsoever as i was only on it for 6 months . I had no nhealth problems prior to taking this drug to help my bone density, it nonly created havoc with my previous good health.
Fosamax tended to hold the line, i.e., my bone density did not progress rapidly.


It never increased the density.  The density decreased gradually.
The wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  The doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis I had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really I was a manic-depressive (which I am not).  Apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  This is what I thought was implied.  Boy have I been glad that someone came up with lamical.
The dizziness subsided, the auras appeared a lot more infrequently
I'm a college student and it was hard to focus on school work, i would hardly listen to conversations, my reading skills were awful, i felt like i was just scanning the words and not really comprehending.
Only two days after my first injection my life started changing radically!


Reduced joint swellings. Increased mobility. Sleeping much better.


And I feel better for every day!
When I started using Macrodantin it helped for the releive of bladder infections and also the pain of chronic cystitis. After a few years the side effects became more and the effectiveness of the drug less. I started getting bladder infections more frequently while I was still on the drug.
I found that it did nothing for my acid reflux.  Only after I changed how, what and when I ate did I recieve instant relief from both the acid reflux and the chronic bronchitis.
I experienced some alleviation to the constipation but it was not ongoing.  It was temporary & it was not regular.  I expected that the treatment would be a cure not jsu a temporary relief.
Increased confidence, more frequent sex, renewed intimacy with partner.
I suffer with tension and headaches caused by stress. Headaches and tension in my back and shoulders, i find that nurofen is the only drug that will subside them releasing the tension and pain. Nurofen permits me to continue with my work or daily activities.
pain was relieved and could sleep with ease
less severe depression. Lessoning of anxiety.
By taking the pills anytime I feel the vaguest possibility that I might be getting a cold sore, I was able to reduce the number of outbreaks. The outbreaks that I do have (if, for example, I don't take the Valtrex in time) seem not as bad as they would be without the Valtrex. The outbreaks seem somehow less... viral. As in, the sores may still form, but the entire process of blistering/opening/scabbing doesn't feel quite as much like my face is a nuclear radiation site.
The treatment easy and convenient and effective for skin turnover to prevent acne.
I experienced almost immediate relief of both bursitis in my left thigh and tennis elbow in my right aarm.  I also had a strained muscle in lower back area which I also experienced relief from.  The bursitis had been bothering me for quite some time (8mths)and mainly at nighttime when I was lying down in bed.  I found it difficult to get comfortable and often used a hot water bottle to soothe it.
the benefits were i was still depressed but not as bad and anything was better then that  all in all i should of had the anti bipolar med the damn doc thought i was bipolar
After 6 weeks began to reduce the itchy swollen eyes.  Long distance vision gradually cleared and returned to near normal.  After an additional three weeks the itchiness is continuing to reduce and the distance vision is continuing to improve.  Eyes are still itchy but I have gone from putting over-the-counter eye drops in my eyes more than 10x during an eight hour period to about 2x during an eight hour period.  I have improved from barely being able to read the top line of the eye chart to almost normal vision.
Was exposed to an STD, this medication got rid of it. Was also taking Cipro to cure a UTI.
My infection cleared up within a couple of days.
This dosage was supposed to help the thyroid function correctly. However, it appeared to make me more lethargic, even though the blood test showed that it was working correctly. I experienced more benefit from exercise than from taking this mandatory drug.
Considerable reduction in muscle pain and increased energy
I had less pain and less stiffness.
Easy to take (1 pill before bed), noticably helped me think more clearly, speak better, organize thoughts so I could accomplish small projects.  Before the Aricept, I couldn't sort things (laundry, paperwork, bills), couldn't remember to eat, brush teeth, shower, etc.
Made an acne mask with aspirin, yea not conventional but it helps buff the skin and i hear it has healing properties. You can add aloe vera gel to it for soothing properties. aspirin is said to prolong ur life, i read that once but can't remember where i think it was on the news...or some news article
Seemed to numb me up and help for sleeping without discomfort while sleeping. Still woke up a couple times with some achey-ness.
In only took the pill for a month, so I do not think it was enough time to see the benefits.
more motivated and focused to accomplish daily activities, increased feelings of energy and decreased feelings of uselessness
In the beginning my seizures seemed to decrease, however at the time I was also on Depakote and Diamox as well as valium for right temporal lobe epilepsy; my doctor added keppra before he started weaning me off the depakote and diamox. I was feeling a lot better on all those meds. Then just the Keppra.
Stopped steady weight gain, lethargy and insomnia. Also seemed to help with my problems with poor ciculation and generalized brain fog (inability to focus).
Pristiq elevated mood and energy levels.
Increased energy and memory.  Levothyroxine treatment alone was not working well.  The combination works much better.
stabilized mood, allowed for clearer thinking, improved sleep pattern, felt less anxious, made world look bright again.
I was able to breathe much easier with this inhaler.
I have debilitating panic attacks. After I was on Zoloft for a couple of weeks I noticed a substantial difference. I no longer felt the "looming dread" that comes with a panic attack and I just felt calmer and more in control than before. I was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease.
It was calming within a very short time.  At the onset of an attack, just having the medicine on hand was calming. It began to work very quickly after taking it.
Dilantin provided Control of seizures


(mostly petits) as these were more frequent.


Generally, the drug is still as effective as when


first introduced to me so there has


been little need for increasing the dosage.


It was imperative in my treatment, though, that the drug be NON GENERIC ONLY.
Zyrtec helped to control my runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing throughout the spring allergy season. It also proved useful as an antihistamine whenever I had similar symptoms after the normal allergy season (March through April).
Within 3-4 weeks I had no depression and less hyperactivity; I was better able to organize my work and accomplish daily tasks; it regulated my sleep cycle. I told my husband that this must be what 'normal' (non-depressed, non-ADHD) adults feel like.
Elevation of mood and clarity of thought.  Progress stalled out at 300 mg, but with increase to 450 mg can tell the difference.  I'm able to finally think and plan ahead and chip away at all the clutter I've not been able to deal with which accumulated while depressed.
I was actually throwing up a couple of times a week during the night. Found I had Barretts and the treatment cleared up the Barretts after about 5 years.
Medications for the graves disease were not keeping the thyroid levels at a constant state. Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years.
Improved joint stiffness, less fatigue, better mobility, less pain and joint swelling, improved mood because of improved mobility
The first time I took it the cold sore ended up just slightly smaller than they usually are. The second time it was about 1/2 the size. The third time it got red and itchy but it didn't actually blister. The forth time I didn't take the medication because it was only the size of a small pimple. I used to get them about every 4 to 6 weeks but the last one came about 4 months after the previous one.
I saw measurable difference in reduction of blackheads and pore size. I was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. I had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  My skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time.
The Ibuprofen gel would enable instant relief as it could be applied topically and carried around easily in ones pocket/bag.


The Diclomax SR tablets tended to work quite quickly therefore providing quick relief. I also used an ice pack which combined with the other treatments mentioned gave me round the clock relief.
It effectively stopped migraine at the "aura" stage.  No need to take any additional medications.
with the treatment I feel less tired and more energetic.I comeback to my normal weight and I stop losing my hair. Also I do not get cold as I use to.
Opened airways to help breath
Anti-inflammatory effect on my joints helped a lot especially my spine.

The adderall allows me to focus and study better.  I definitely function better while taking it.  I am prescribed to take it "as needed" which means that I don't take it everyday.  I tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  I am prescribed to take it up to 3 times a day, but I rarely have taken that much.
Severe long term depression and anxiety were alleviated.
Ability to focus, not become so disoriented.  Able to think more clearly.
It did help to control bladder infections.
The benefits of Seasonale is that you only have your period once every three months.
prevented infection of surgically sewn gums.  They cut my gums and pulled them down further over the teeth and added a laboratory grown skin product to make the gum larger.  I also used this periogard bottle when they put caps on my teeth, just to prevent infection.
Effectively lowers blood pressure with very few side effects and NO cough, No drowsiness and no sexual problems of any kind!!!
Less pain in joints, better mobility.  Better able to perform tasks of daily living.  Less stiffness.
The ranitidine was very effective in releaving my symptoms of acid reflux.  After several months of treatment my stomach, which previously felt nauseated on a daily basis, felt much better and very rarely caused me discomfort.
Sleeping was possible.  It works well without making me sleepy the next day like Ambien did.  It also works quickly as long as you lie down right away.
The infection that developed at the site of my oral surgery subsided and this allowed the wound to begin to heal.
felt better after 3 days...... ... ....... .... ...... ...... ...............
Loss of apetite, feeling of well being,satiety with small portions of food.
Extremely better clarity of mind.  Much higher energy.  More strength.  More optimism.  More vigor.
I started using Skinoren along with a treatment of benzoil peroxide and alpha hydroxy lotion as part of a regimen to attempt to clear up ongoing, stubborn adult acne. within about five or six days my skin started clearing up.
small improvement in chloresteral level
Decreased the number of acne lesions.
Eased the leg pain.  I had full range of motion in knee.
Levoxyl improved lab results, but I still felt tired, had dry skin and some constipation. Adding Cytomel fine tuned treatment and all symptoms resolved.
lowered blood pressure
I have taken this drug for four years, with a hiatus of about 1 year because I was afraid of dire side affects that had been widely advertised, having to do with the deterioration of jaw bone. The alendronate did not seem to stop the slow progression of my osteopenia, as measured by yearly bone density scans. I tried a regular exercise program, using a vibration machine (powerplate) and that stopped the progression of my osteopenia. I stopped the alendronate medication, thinking the exercise was more helpful and I was afraid of side effects.  However, the exercise alone did not work. I have re-started the alendronate medication and am hoping that the combination of the medication and exercise will help.
To treat add.  To releave sudden impulsive behavor.  To help me focus on things that I had to do.  To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships.
I had felt very tired all the time before I started taking the medication.  Also my skin and hair seemed to be very dry.  I have noticed a significant improvement in my energy level since taking the medication.  Also my skin and hair have both improved over time.
Significant reduction in pain and stiffness with 24 hours, lasting about a week.  Am going to ask my doctor if it is possible to change to weekly injections, as am now alternating between happiness and misery on a weekly basis, as the effect wears out after seven days.
This drug definately does have an effect on depression.  I went on a trip and while I had enough for the duration of the trip, I ran out the day I returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  I noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  Although I tried to keep a "stiff upper lip" my husband noticed the change.
Reduced the pain.
I had Graves disease in 1990 which indicated that my thyroid function was way too high.  The symptoms were anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and restlessness. I was administered an uptake test and I received radioactive iodine therapy to slow down my thyroid function.  This threw me into a state of low thyroid function.  Synthoid balances my thyroid function to normal and the negative symptoms disappeared.
Metformin restored my periods , got rid of the cysts on my ovaries and help me lose weight , restored insulin levels
I had smoked for 20 years and despite repeated quit attempts using Zyban (bupropion), nicotine patches (and nicotine gum, lozenges etc), I had never managed to stay quit for long. Chantix enabled me to quit my 10 cigar a day habit with minimal craving and after the first week of treatment I really didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore.
It cured the MRSA. Major downside was high price. The resulting yeast infection was a bit irritating but not unexpected.I would highly recmmend zyvox to anyone with this particular strain of MRSA.
the doctor prescibed this drug to help with my blood pressure problem. it was moderately high, around 140/100, but I didn't like the side effects. I decided to try losing some weight to improve blood pressure and it seems to be getting better. it is now about 130/95 and will probably continue to fall.
lowered blood sugar readings some what. Generally speaking I feel it has few benefits, however I feel it may have some way balanced my hormones... increased my sex drive I think but not sure.
subsided panic attacks,(although not always)
I thought the medication did an okay job.  My anxiety never entirely disappeared, but there was a noticeable reduction.  The medication would probably have been more effective had it been combined with a talking therapy, but it was not.
Improved skin condition. Blackheads are noticibly smaller and the the pores are not as noticeable.  Fine wrinckles have been minimized. My skin is no longer so oily which I like.
overal improvment in mood, cognitions and phyiscal symptoms. feelings of helplessness, worthlessness gradually subsided. Negative cognitions e.g. suicidal ideations were dimenshed, although it took a while for it to happen
I am more able to stay on task and finish what I start.   I don't make so many mistakes in the details of my work.  I am more able to concentrate consistantly on a project and not get so easily distracted.  I am more confident that my work will be done well and in a timely manner.
join pain and swelling
Cleared up my Acne Vulgaris (acne turned into a big boil) and also coincidentally helped manage my lung condition. Usually I take ciprofloxacin 750mg twice a day, two weeks on and two weeks off for my CF, in addition to Azithromycin 250mg every day..BUT when I am off the Cipro i find that my lung condition very gradually deteriorates when I am not on Cipro. My finding was that when I was off the Cipro, and on the Doxycycline, the Doxycycline happen to help "maintain"or slow down the exacerbation of my lung condition.
i was experiencing nausea without vomiting. The doctor prescribed stemetil 3x daily.  The first day the nausea was largely alleviated by the taking the stemetil.
It was helpful in reducing the severity on my life-long extremely dry, flaky, itchy skin. It was recommended that I be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. This is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the Lac-hydrin. Unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions I've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. Ultimately, I've found BETTER results with the much cheaper Eucerin and even Curel moisturizing lines.
improve the skin appareance making it thicker and more resistent to enviroment agressions besides acne lessions for those who suffer the disease are drastic reduce making even the skin apereance looking it softer and radiant
Hair loss was abated and some regrowth occurred but not on the crown area. Also hair thickness and strength appeared better.
None.  My LDL level did not drop.
Within 4 days my skin became visibly smoother, pore size was markedly reduced very quickly and after just a few weeks there was increased firmness and generally younger looking skin. Crows feet and forehead lines also diminshed. Skin strength was greatly improved and I did not need to where make-up to hide imperfections as much, my skin looked more polished.
With using generic finasteride there's no doubt that further hairloss has been prevented in my case.  Before beginning on this, my hairloss was rapidly escalating, both at the front and back, and this ceased and slightly reversed once started, and hasn't progressed since.
Less sneezing, headaches, and stuffy noses.
I started using Retin-A after the birth of my second child when I broke out with


adult acne.  At the time it was not advertised as an anti aging cream and as I was only 26 or so I really wasn't concerned about wrinkles. Because of the warning of photosensitivity increase to sun exposure I used sunscreen daily (I lived in Tampa,FL). Now at the age of 62 I have gorgeous skin. Yes, I LOVE products but my basic regimen has not changed. Cleansing,Sunscreen and Retinol-A


at bedtime. I had been on HRT for 10 years  so that should be factored in to the equation.
After suffering with chronic insomnia for the majority of my adult life, and after all of the popular sleep meds failed, I found Xyrem and it has changed my life. I am now in control of when I go to sleep and when I wake. The depression (Beck Index: 28) vanished after 3 weeks of treatment (Beck Index: 5). Anxiety has also abated. Loss of fat, increase in muscle size and strength. Improved energy. Improved interaction with friends and family.
Don't believe that I took it long enough to really tell if it was working. I had an allergic reaction shortly after I started taking it.
Totally reduced anxiety around presenting information to groups.  Made it possible to think clearly and give an effective class.
Greater energy, almost twice as much faster recovery from excercises and workouts. Much reduced muscle and joint pain compared to pre treatment, losing some weight, appetite control and feeling satisfied with less food. Less junk food cravings.
sun damage (freckles on forehead) have gone, wrinkles are less
Hair came back from a thinning status and a visible scalp through the hair to a much thicker condition with little visible scalp through the hair..


confidence back. i no longer look older than i feel and think my overall esteem has been improved
none
I PREVENTED PREGNANCY
I have seen a great improvement since taking Zoloft.  I am a classic type A person and tend toward anxiety when I have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  I asked my physician about Zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and I was under alot of stress at work.  I sleep much better, am more even tempered, and more optimistic when taking Zoloft.  Another benefit, probably due to my anxiety being under control, is that I think more clearly.  I don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work.
Treatment benefits consisted of weight gain after pronounced weight loss due to thyroid tumor.  Although the patient felt that there was a greater weight gain than she desired.
Hair loss almost stopped, although minor loss continued.
Due to unresponsiveness to acetaminophen and negative side effects from aspirin and ibuprofen, I was given a prescription to Percocet.  This did a wonderful job reliving the pain.  I now live a pain free life.
within a month of starting treatment eyelashes started to grow thicker, longer and darker
I lost ten pounds in the first month.  I was given 90 more days....and doing well.
On amlodipine 5mg, controlled BP but ocassional spikes of HTN when dose should have controlled all day, doctor prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 25mg as well in response.
I usually wake up in the middle of the night with a migraine.  I take a Zomig immediately and usually within an hour the pain is gone.  I've been taking Zomig for over a decade and won't go anywhere without them.
After having a severe outbreak of psoriasis Enbrel was the only one that cleared it up in about a month. been on medication almost three years and still have some psoriasis flare ups but not as bad as it was before. Maybe caused more due to stress. Also joint swelling and pain in my legs have gone away still feel fatigued sometimes but common with the disease.
I felt more stable in my daily activities; more capable of handling stress; and better able to successfully complete my daily responsibilities of working nights, parenting three children and keeping a house running at an acceptable level.
Reduced discomfort from ulcer.
Using Nasonex improved my sneezing, runny nose and stuffiness from year round allergies.  I no longer had to carry tissues with me everywhere I went.  My sleep improved and I was more alert at work.
Methotrexate kept the RA from progressing rapidly. Pain, swelling and stiffness were noticeably less when taking medication. It did not stop RA progress completely. In addition, arthritis nodules did develop.
Facial redness decreased within the first month. Facial flushing was decreased.
Yes would recommend this drug for people with mild depression,
A feeling of relaxed euphoria; i.e., not worrying about anything and feeling slightly "buzzed"
Some decrease in headahces.  However, now all these years later taking estradiol, I look younger than my friends and my skin is in much better condition.  I'm not wrinkle free, but have fewer than most women my age who have not had hormone therapy.
The treatment effectively got rid of my infection and also alleviated my pain after taking twice(on day).
Considerable weight loss, increased energy, decreased appetite,
After intolerable side effects of an anti depressant it relaxed my stomach (stopped vomiting) relaxed muscles so constant shaking and shivering subsided,helped me sleep and for me to actually have normal and relaxed thoughts.





Taken when needed from normal anxiety it just relaxes body and mind... it's long lasting nature often means that
more restful sleep. which helped me to be more alert during the day and less nervous and paniky thinking about my inability to sleep at night knowing I had to work the next day.
I had severe depression with agitation and mixed-state bipolar hypomania. I was insomniac. I took abilify 5mg for 3 mos, and then I upped it to 10mg.
releved pain for 1 hour but then has no more effect and caused pain not reileif possibly ebcause of `the fast i had high blood pr1essure but did not read it has high sodium, (low sodium diet for over 3 years)
kept the high blood pressure normal. of course patient has also changed lifestyle - exercising four times a week, eating light sodium and low calorie foods. diet of vegetables and fish or white chicken, fruits and grains, no red meats. we believe it is both lifestyle and medication that have lowered the high blood pressure.
Acute pain in tooth subsided normally within 30 minutes, and the relief lasted 6-8 hours.  Allowed me to sleep the entire night without being awakened by the return of pain.





I was later prescribed Codeine after the procedure, which only dulled the pain to half intensity.
It effectively slowed my hair loss dramatically. My barber of 15 years says my hair has not changed. I notice slight loss over the years, but I still have a lot of hair whereas I would most certainly be bald without it!
Completely eliminated anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and generalized anxiety after dosage of 50 mg/day was taken.  Downsside was that while on 25 mg/day start up dose for the first  7 days anxiety was extremely worsened and almost unbearable.
My head felt very clear for the first time in years. I didn't get rattled as easily. Mood stabilizer is a very good description of it. I was able to get motivated, and not feel the world was ending every time something went wrong. I lost the desire to spend money in a ridiculous fashion.
there were none that I know. Still has osteroposis.  Had to stop because of the stomacjh effect.
Anxiety greatly diminished shortly after taking alprazolam.  The alprazolam was also effective in calming the mind prior to sleep.  I have taken alprazolam for anxiety attacks, worrisome and obsessive thinking and in order to fall asleep.
The stuff works like a charm--fast and effective.
none
Panic attacks and depression completely alleviated; true 'happy pills'. I wish I could keep on taking them indefinitely as I am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future, where I am unhappy and stressed, which can and does lead to depression and negative, sometimes suicidal, thoughts. I found Sertraline completely ineffective for my IBS.
It is extremely, powerful antibiotic, which give immediate effect with in two hours.
ability to concentrate and order thoughts, capacity to work effectively, organise home life, I was able to start tertiary study again and complete assignments and exams where I wasn't able to before due to concentration and motivation issues caused by my condition
Not sure if it is effective or not.  Pain is gone in the morning but steadily increases as the day progresses.  I am virtually unable to function by evening.  I think I may ask my physician to prescribe an additional 5mg to be taken in the afternoon to see if that prevents the pain rebound in the afternoon.
Almost immediate (i.e. within 15 minutes) relieve of severe nerve and/or muscle pain in neck, shoulder &/or lower back. These patches work like a miracle for me, although others who have used them say they offered no relief for muscle or nerve or shingles pain.  I have bone spurs in my neck which sometimes irritate the nerves in my neck and cause excrutiating pain ... also periodic sciatica and shoulder and upper & lower pack pain from an auto accident.  Chiropractic and message helps, but these patches are used when those interventions fail to bring about sufficient relief ... especially for the nerve pain in my neck. I use them only as a last resort.
Overall acid reduction; however, it could be sporadic.  With taking the medication, still had to watch diet and avoid triggering foods.  At times, the medication was not effective.
I went from being in extreme pain and sometimes almost immobile to being able to go back to work at a physical job
I was taking this drug as birth control, and it has been extremely effective.  (No children, yet!) The fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great, so it is difficult to miss a dose. (Unlike the pill, which you take everyday, and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  As an added bonus, I no longer have my period, which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  I no longer suffer from PMS symptoms, either.  I can not complain about this drug at all.
significantly helped in reducing congestion and headaches. Incidence of illiness and or secondary sinus infections were reduced.
My acne has been greatly reduced and my skin is a lot clearer. I also found that my skin is less oily. I saw these results within the first month of using the product.
I have good relief of sneezing, dripping nose, chesty cough, dry throat until a couple of months ago
At first I loved this drug. Panic attacks were getting under control and I didn't feel druggy or fuzzy headed.
within 2 weeks obsessional thoughts were less, so much so that she could return to work, she increased dosage slowly over a few months to maximum 150mgs with marked improvement in her obsessional thinking and she was able to complete a masters degree. After one year slowly decreased dose. Would definately take it again if obsessional thinking returns in the future
Was able to gain control after receiving the injection form of the medication.Was helpful in decreasing aggitation,psychosis,delusions.At the end of the required time in seclusion and after giving medication time to take effect patient was able to return to facility population without any further problems.Was able to maintain in a calm manner,much less aggitated and was able to meet to staff to discuss delional ideas.
There were no benefits that I could perceive.  The hairloss continued but worst of all the side-effects from this drug are severe and permanent.  This is very disturbing!
I never really had any complications with my disease. It seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. It also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has Ulcerative Colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. It really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. The side effects most likely worsened because I was on the drug for a long period of time.
less anxiety, emotional stability
This worked better than an estrogen patch.  I felt better and vagainal atrophy was almost cleared up.
when the drug wears off pain starts to increase to an almost intolerable level after taking 1 dose the pain is swept away and left feeling almost 100% better. BUT I must take 2nd dose in 12 hrs, to keep pain at bay.
I'm told it opens airways, but also hear there are neg side effects. Witout it, I'm a bi more weazy, but not much.
dramatic increase in eyelash growth and thickness, eyelashes became noticably longer after four weeks, with good growth experienced at the 12 week (3 month mark).
The resulting small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) most commonly occur on the palms and fingers of your hands and on the soles and toes of your feet. The blisters usually last for three to four weeks.





The blisters often cause intense itching. Scratching the blisters can damage the skin and, in some cases, lead to infection. Once the blisters dry, they often leave cracks and painful grooves (fissures) in your skin.


Risk factors





Dyshidrosis occurs twice as often in women as in men. Other risk factors include:





    * Stress, because dyshidrosis appears to be more common during times of stress


    * Exposure to metal salts, such as chromium, cobalt and nickel � usually through cement or mechanical work


    * Having seasonal allergies, such as hay fever


    * Frequently exposing your skin to water or other wet substances
Avage contributed to maximum exfoliation to treat both hyperpigmentaion and minimization of lines, creases and wrinkles. It also helped to minimize pore size and added a more radiant look to my skin (it was very dull and drab).
ability to sleep though the night decreasing joint/muscle pain and cramps allowing for a more productive day
Suppression of cough
better thought process - clear thinking


better sleep at night


less anxious
the only complete relief from one sided headache and nausea
Greatly improved the sense of urgency. I usually had to urinate every 20-30 minutes. Now I can go as long a 2-3 hours. I find I need to take it as soon as I get up for the best results.  If I wait I have a morning of running to the bathroom. I used to get up around 3-4 times a night and now get up only once.
no further hot flushes and palpitations, no mild panic attacks ,much improved sleep pattern, skin tone improved, much more positve attitude and general wellbeing, lowered cholesterol, and loss of weight gained prior to HRT, and also feel that my joints and flexibility has been maintained as physically I really am in much better shape and stronger than non HRT taking friends, and I am not an exerciser but am very activeie. paint the house, walk the dog etc
I feel like a new person. I've had an MRI and all sorts of other tests and no one can find anything wrong with my right hip. I believe I tore the hip flexor several years ago in a yoga class and it never healed properly. Sitting at a desk for work aggravates the pain, and I bike every day which isn't good for it either. Additionally from sitting every day, my upper back and shoulders are often in pain. Celebrex took ALL aches away, and took my hip pain from a constant worrying sharp pain, down to a very mild twinge. LOVE IT.
The sores and scabs healed quite quickly once started on the medication.  Problem was misdiagnosed for about 2 weeks, before a new diagnosis was obtained.


There were no side effects physically while taking the medication.  Quick recovery process.
30 year smoker at 1.5 packs per day
Solodyn contains minocycline and is formulated to be taken once a day. This was very convenient and easy to remember. It can be taken with or without food. The Solodyn seemed to reduce the number of inflammatory lesions, and reduced irritation and itching was considerably.
Relieved depression.
The course of treatment reduced the severity and the frequency of the neck pain and migraines by about 50%.
Alleviated deep depression.
The small pimples that accompany perioral dermatitis clear much more quickly with metrolotion.  The dry, red, irritated patches might be slightly calmed by the metrolotion, but topical cortisone is needed to clear them.
I have been on every SSRI made- trial after disappointing trial since I was 19. This is the first medication that has worked for any length of time. (Paxil worked for a short period of time but maxed out w/o further benefit even with augmentation).
my fever was reduced but just for a while, as i threw up almost every 30 minutes after taking the medication and and until i emptied my stomach, the nausea was constant with every intake of the drug .
I have had a cough for 15 years I related to allergies, plus post nasal drip that kept me up at night coughing.  Had sinus infections every year and then twice a year, went to dr and would be on antibiotics for 10 days or so and get better.  Well I finally went to a specialist and all the previous years I thought I was better, I was not.  My sinus were so infected he said I had a chronic sinus infection which was probably 4 years old.  He treated me for months with antibiotics and still could not clear up infection.  Sent me to Ear, nose , throat dr. and he wanted to do surgery right away.  That was 2 months ago.  After using the Flonase in combination with singular I have not had any problems.  Post nasal drip gone!!! which is a huge blessing.  Wish I had this nasal spray 10 years ago.
Significant reduction in acne lesions.  The size, frequency and severity of the lesions was reduced in the first week of use.
Treatment benefits were pregnancy prevention and regulation of menstrual cycle.
I have had 1-2 sinus infections anually, compared to one every 4-6 weeks prior.  I had sinus surgery, THE MOST PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE, some 20 years ago. I cannot recall the last infection I have had since beginning this treatment.
Got rid of the infection completely.
Definite lowering of feet and leg pain, numbness and foot-sensory control.  However due to the length of diagnostic time required and the progressiveness of the problem, Cymbalta (in a.m.) and Lyrica (in p.m.) work well together.  The neuropathy does not both me at night, once I am laying down and settled.
The Ranitidine can be taken at any, time throught out the day, with or without food, but should be taken with lots of water. can try 30 mag first then 60 mg etc.


It can be taken up to 4 times per day.
Good for sleep and to ease a tension headache and restlessness. You should take it only at beadtime, don't take it before driving a car. For me there are no side effects because of low dose probably. Ideal to balance your mood and improve your life quality.
+Easier to get up and get going in the morning.


+Increased self esteem.


+Increased confidence.


+Some mood stabilization.


+Significant decrease in skin-picking.


+Increased overall energy.


+Reduction in feelings of guilt and avoidance.


+Enhanced social capacity: less inhibited, more likely to engage in conversation, more interested in others, less sensitive to surroundings, more open and increased assertiveness.
NONE
Pain relief that was seen within 30 minutes.  If migraine was not reduced then a second 25 mg tablet is taken after the 30 minutes.
Absolutely none. My original dr. prescribed me Xanax, which, for me, is a life-saver. New dr. wouldn't put me on it, so I got Klonopin instead,(1mg, 3x's/day). After Klonopin made me sleepy, I asked for the only other bz he was willing to prescribe,(Ativan),and w/in one week was going through massive w/drawals from the lack of potency of the drug. So, back on Klonopin and the problems went away like that. May as well have been a sugar pill. Needless to say, I found a dr. to prescribe Xanax, and have had no problems since.
I was able to get rid of an infection that had been bothering for awhile.
Chronic pain from degenerated cervical vertebra. Bulging discs indenting the dural sac reaching the cord from C5/7 without cord compromise.osteophytes pinching nerve roots bilateral C6. C7/t1 and T 2 Anterolisthesis
The ativan decreased my anxiety so that I was able to sleep through the night.
Oily skin & hair reduced, clear skin, long lasting results!
I was given this birth control to help stabilize my hormones to aid in clearing up my acne.  I never saw a significant improvement in my acne.
Zithromax was uesd to cure the bacterial infection that was located in my lungs. The drug also cured a minor cut infection.
treated hypomanic systems, reduced impulsivity; reduced cravings for alcohol; reduced irratibility; loss of weight (15 lbs); more stable moods;
There were no benefits to this treatment.
cessation of hot flashes, vaginal dryness.  The patch is clean and always delivers the same amount of medication, so it is very reliable
eliminated urinary tract infection symptoms
No irregular cycles right now, very little cramping or other PMS symptoms.
Clearing of sinus infection and bronchitis.  Used a few times for same problem, sometimes after trial of azythromicin (which did nothing) or doxycycline which  also did very little.
The treatment benefits were that my cholestrol levels went from 9 to the 4-5 level.  This was demonstrated by regular blood test results.
i have had eustachian tube pain in my neck for about 2 years most days, and almost everyday this last year.  this is the only thing that has ever worked to relieve the pain, and as a benefit it helped with some mild allergies.  LOVE IT
Was to prevent thinning of bones
Eliminated physical craving for alcohol. Relaxing. Reduced anxiety. Lowered blood presssure and heart rate.


I had been unable to taper off or quit drinking alcohol for over 3 years, and drinking was affecting my work and home life. I was frightened of the severe anxiety when I would try to stop drinking. Working with my PCP we agreed on this threatment, which worked.
depression was alleviated to a functional degree.I wasn't in lala land but was able to get out of bed and care for my children. I was never suicidal or violent
I have suffered from acne for 10+ years, and let me tell you, Accutane is the only thing that's worked for me.  Improvement in skin in days... clear skin in a couple weeks.  I have tried almost every treatment out there, and no results have compared to those I got from using Accutane.  Take it from someone who's suffered a long time: try it and you won't be sorry.  Be wary of some of the possible side effects, though.  I didn't experience anything too drastic, but everyone's different.
I had very stron earache, which made me unable to work. High-dose Aspirin did not help, nor did Paracetamol. However, Ibuprofen worked perfectly: my pain was letely compgone as long as the tablet taken twas effective. Only about half an hour before I was allowed to take the next tablet did my earache start again. I was very happy!!
Initially, Lexapro helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work, children, college assignments,etc.) I was able to handle better.
I had a complete hysterectomy at age 52 and started HRT to avoid the immediate menapause which occurred right after surgery. Unfortunately the hospital staff put me on the estrogen patch which did not work and I was miserable the first couple of nights with severe hot flashes and poor sleep waking up often with soaked clothes and the sensation of itching everywhere during the day. Once my GYN doc changed me over to Premarin .625mg everything adverse disappeared and I enjoyed no menapausal hot flashes,mood swings, loss of sleep, vaginal dryness and my skin benefited as well, no lines or wrinkles and good elasticity.
It alleviated my Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(Gerd)symptoms as long as I took the medicine as prescribed by the doctor,one capsule, once a day.
I regained my hearing after a virus caused sudden sensorineural hearing loss in my left ear by taking Prednisone.
After taking Altase, then Lisinopril, began Diovan, first 80 MG, then 160. The "ACE" cough disappeared with the 80 MG almost immediately. However morning surge BP continued.
No change in acne despite 15 days of usage -- probably antibiotic resistant.
Completely took away my severe chronic body pain. I was able to sleep at night and was not fatigued during the day. You have to be very careful with the dosage and slowly increase it, but it is completely worth it.

Topamax greatly reduced severe migraines that were occurring almost daily and it  seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers that caused my migraines(stress, changes in barometric pressure,certain food,smells,noise, and light),stabled moods,reduced irritability, increased weight loss(40lb).

If used regularly, this treatment eliminates the white and rough spots my daughter gets all over her arms and hands (and in some cases, her legs).
Quit smoking in 90 days
Almost completely Stopped seizures
Definite improvement in mood, particularly at the beginning of treatment. Much better stability with moods and PMS symptoms in particular. I do think that I don't feel it is as effective now as when I started but still feel better than without it and would not stop treatment.
Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter "reuptake" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).
I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for "in-shape" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded.
improvement in daytime wakefulness without the "peaks and valleys" previously experienced taking prescription Ritalin for this condition. There's no excessive nervousness or feeling like I'm taking speed.  I just don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
Mirtazapine was very effective in treating chronic insomnia. I was not sleeping due to severe anxiety and moderate depression. The drug has significantly improved anxiety symptoms and is gradually lifting mood and reducing depression symptoms
With OAB there was the urge to urinate frequently which felt like a constant mild bladder infection.  There was some relief after a couple of days on this drug. However, some days I felt as poorly as I did without them.  But after approximately 8 weeks almost all of the discomfort was gone.  I feel pretty normal.  One key to making this work is to deliberately not urinate too often.  I have noticed that now I sometimes need to remind myself to go.  I probably feel the urge less than I did before I had this problem.
prevacid kept me from from having acid reflux.. Have been taking this drug for about 4 years..
I find that this drug effectively eliminates symptoms of restless leg syndrome.  When having to sit in one position for extended periods (long air flights, car trips, meetings,) I experience great discomfort and an almost uncontrollable need to move my legs.  This drug eliminates all discomfort and compulsion to move.  It's terrific!
to reduce headache
Before taking Lexapro I had severe anxiety attacks, by myself, when i would cry uncontrolably for about 30 mins each night. I would also have random panick attacks in public, triggerd by fealings of self conciesness, insecurity and confusion. After taking the medication, these problems were aliviated.
some clearing of acne but not completely. re-occurrence still happened. Scarring was still there. Overall, did not feel that effectiveness was best. Possibly a more natural cure would have been better.
Reduced incidence of cyctic acne.  Supposed anti-aging/reduced wrinkles are widely published.  I can't confirm these benefits, as I treated my whole face and don't know what it would have looked like without treatment.
took the reglan to try to empty my stomach before i threw up and the reglan didnt work  -  the tagamet helped - scale 1-10 a 10

Stops acid reflux back into esophagus causes by eating, stooping, bending or even sitting in a position that pushes the stomach up, or just from eating even if standing.  Prevents burns to esophagus that can lead to esophageal cancer and ongoing pain.
Lyrica reduced the pain associated with my anklosing spondylytis when other therapies had failed.  I had tingling, numbness, pain, and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling, very little numbness, and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug!
No longer fell asleep at inappropriate and dangerous times. For the first time in my adult life I was able to concentrate. I was able to effectively work and study.
Completely cleared up my acne b/4 my wedding.
I did eventually fall asleep but it took a while (was told it only takes 20-30 min. but ended up being a couple hours, I read and eventually fall asleep and then the quality of sleep was poor; I just toss and turn all night I have 23 left I'll keep taking till gone, maybe they will improve over time.
The drug stopped my menstrual periods and put me into artificial menopause.  The hope was that it would trigger my body to go into menpause and stop the heavy bleeding associated with my fibroids.  Unfortunately, my period came back approximately 2 months after the last injection
I have been able to maintain sobriety and get my life back on track.  Methadone has allowed me to get my "bearings" underneath me, and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months, I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task.
I am less angry, sleep a little better, MUCH less anxious. I am able to play with the kids without unhappily obsessing over all the things I should be working on. I can just chill out and be in the moment.
Elimated restless feeling and able to sleep at night. The main thing is that I do not go off the deep end when something goes wrong or that I do not control. I also had the side / added benefit of dropping fifteen pounds within the first two monhts of starting medication which also naturally makes you feel better as well.
this drug helped the swelling i had in my mouth from an infected area above my wisdom tooth. it didn't help with the pain, i had to take another prescription drug to get all of the swelling and pain to a bearable level. the
mild pain reduction in arm/wrist
I had migraines everyday, this slowly worked it up to where i'd only get a mild migraine once maybe twice a week at most.
make me worry less, and did make me feel better about life in general. it made my mood switch from being completely depressed and miserable to happy.
The benefits allowed me to physically calm.  this allowed me to sleep better, eat less and encourage a better outlook. Without Tramal life was very down.
My headaches have been considerably reduced; however, I still experience some mild headaches. The relief from my chronic and debilitating headaches has been a miracle thus far, and while I've had some pretty irritating side effects, I'm willing to put up with them so that I can live my life relatively pain free. I'm hoping the pain will pass.
allergies were completely cleared up while on the medication.
Pustules disappeared and the redness diminished
IT decreased mildly elevated Prolactin immediately from 25 units to 10 units. (mg/l ?)


It also increased my sex drive, but this stopped after a while. 





It also moderately decreased Psoriatic Arthritis pains and also symptoms in nails and joints, but needed to be taken very regular for this.. Forgetting to take it twice a week already made it work less effective.





(Cabergoline was more effective, had less side effects- but potentially has side effects on heart valve, so one needs to be very careful with it. )
Diminished hot flushes, mood swings, anxiety, skin plumped out and wrinkles decreased, depression lessened, concentration and memory and focus improved.
It did lower my cholesterol slightly, but that may have also been du to a change in my diet.
IT WAS supposed to help after major dental surgery?  I HAD ALL MY UPPER TEETH EXTRACTED, AND 4 TEETH EXTRACTED FROM MY LOWER TEETH.  I HAD ROOT PLANING DONE ON BOTH UPPER AND LOWER MOUTH. SURGERY WAS DONE WITH TWILIGHT SLEEP ON AN OUT PATIENT BASIS.  I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MOUTH NOW AND EVEN MY GUM DISEASE IS IMPROVING,
I waited about 12 hours after surgery - till incision began to hurt - before I took the drug. It might have been move effective if I had taken it before pain started. As it was, it took about two hours to get relief.
it makes me not nervous and i think it helps with depression also
balancing of thyroid back to normal range. Prior to treatment, patient had some mental confusion, weight gain, needed extreme amounts of sleep.  With treatment, mental acuity was obtained, weight stablized, energy increased. At one time treatment was discontinued for one month by MD to ensure that the thyroid gland was not producing adequate amounts of thyroid. Patient was put back on treatment after blood tests confirmed levels in bloodstream.  This treatment has made a positive difference in patients life.
Almost complete removal of all existing and future acne. I took this drug with meals and could not be happier. Accutane changed the whole composition of my skin, changing me from very oily to normal/dehydrated in just over two weeks. The remainder of the dosage resulted in secureing my clarity and allowing my skin to look and feel better.
Maintained a general feeling of well being and being able to cope with life. When I stopped the treatment (gradually) the depression returned after a couple of months. Having suffered from depression periodically over a number of years, I feel my quality of life has increased with Prozac.
Depression lifted, more energy, more focus, more productive at work and school, able to laugh and smile, still felt sad or upset sometime (which is good because it means I didn't feel numb like some anti-depressants make you feel, sleep better.
I was suffering from mild back pain for a sports injury and also insomnia.  Not only was my back pain temporarily eliviated, I got uninterrupted sleep while I was taking this medication.  Before then, I hadn't slept for almost a week straight.  It was very important that I allowed at least eight hours of sleep.  I made the mistake a couple of times of taking it when I wasn't going to get a full nights sleep and ended up severely drowsy and unalert.  On those two occasions, I "made-up" for the missed hours of sleep and over slept.  This did not help, as it furthered my sleepiness.  I sort of had to get on a schedule again.  





When taken properly, it can be very helpful.
reduced nausea from continual to episodic, feeling of fullness decreased
Prozac makes me feel just stabilized not really "Happy",it really just levels me out so i can cope with everyday life and the stresses involved. It was one of the better medications i have tried and have tried several over the past few years that really did nothing. Seroquel was also prescribed for sleeping . I took that in combination with the clonazepam
reduction of hot flashes, and reduction of vaginal dryness. I'd already been trying a vaginal estrogen ring, but this wasn't enough of a dose for me, apparently. Since taking out the ring, which I'd had in for 6 months, and using the cream instead, things have been a lot better (i.e. less dryness, and less pain with intercourse. Yay!
None.  This product as all prescription and nonprecriptions products that are available in the USA have offered no relief whatsoever from the flushing of Rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.
Effexor was prescribed to alleviate hot flashes, and to help me sleep through the night.
Candida rashes did not disappear. I was doing an anti-candida diet at the same time. i.e cutting out sugars, refined carbs etc. and taking oregano oil, probiotics, pau d'arco tea, caprylic acid. Cream did not work any better than ti tree oil.
Lunesta definitely put me to sleep and kept me asleep until morning.
I didn't feel my joint pain after taking this, I think because I was too bothered by the side effects.
My cystic acne was reduced. My face did clear up consistently with the help of the pills and creams such as retin-a.
Made the patient feel normal pretty much.
After 6 weeks of taking 10 mg  of Prozac, physical anxiety symptoms  dramatically dimished. Now, 6 months after beginning treatment, my blood pressure has also fallen. With BP medication alone, my BP hovered around 135/85. Couple with Prozac, my blood pressure is consistantly in the 110-120 over 80-80 range. I also experience very little panic attacks ( I used to have several a day). When I do experience one, I have been able to self talk myself down from it.
leveled out emotional highs and lows
Reduced swelling and pain after about two days.  Then on the third day, started to get stomach cramps that settled into lower right abdomen.  Initial injection on Monday night, cramps by Thursday noon, emergency room Thursday night, appendix removed Saturday morning.
Minimal, if any.
to eliminate sores on stump and siezures
I am sleeping more deeply, especially during the first four or five hours after falling asleep.  I still have hot flashes during those hours, however I seem to be in a deeper state of sleep and during those hours I usually don't fully awake during the hot flash, as I used to do.  I used to be almost fully awake every time I experienced a hot flash (every 1 to 1.5 hours).  Now I get a few hours of fairly good sleep at the beginning of my sleep cycle.
This drug reduced inflammation in the nasal passages, successfully treated hay-fever type symptoms, and also helped with hoarseness probably due to the fact that it cleared up post nasal drip.  I like to sing and I found I could sing longer without getting hoarse.
Helped to promote sleep without side effects, hangover or any of the other problems associated with other sleep medications.  The sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called Celexa, which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the Celexa was stopped.  Ever since taking the Celexa my nervous system has been exquisitely sensitive, with symptoms such as pain, heart palpitations, restless legs, and other such things that totally interrupted my ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.
I had inflammation in my ribs due to severe coughing from bronchitis.  Doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  Tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep.
no problems with either meds
Very effective at eliminating pain.
Cleared my acne after 2 months with sporadic breakout but not as severe before starting regiment. Wrinkles reduced and cleared scarring as well. My skin texture improved dramatically. Hyperpigmentation disappeared and skin seems to be resilient to wrinkles.
Successful management of post-op pain following reconstructive foot surgery including osteotomy with split tendon transfer.
feeling really relieved from the effects of usual depression, that i had for more than 10 years : feeling very low, no energy, daily crying, fear from future, unhappiness and underestimation of myself, regular temptation of suicide, thought i never tried to kill myself, the idea was becoming an obsession. And this terrible feeling of pretending all the time, at work, with friends, that i was ok, had disappeared. 


Before getting pregnant, i was a bit afraid that i have to stop the medication by my doctor told me to go on, that there was no known side effect with pregnancy, so i went on. My son is now 14 months old and is a wonderful healthy little boy, with a happy mother !
The Zydol was effective in reducing my pain after the dose was increased from 50 mg to 100 mg.  The Diazepam made me sleep all the time which was a good thing as I believe the body heals while sleeping
some reduced frequency in urination. didn't seem to reduce urgency

the bacterial infection was treated effectively.
There was no benefit for either my neuropathic pain or migraine headaches.
Helped reduce nasal discomforts from seasonal allergies.  I had reduced nasal drainage, less sneezing and less eye irritation.
It did help dull my foot pain.
It did get rid of my headache.
Help me sleep 6 hours
I experienced nearly immediate decreased acne, without any of the dreaded sun sensitivity. It decrease papuless, whiteheads and blackheads all similarly. The medicine took effect almost immediately. I was not aware was supposed to take on empty stomach and yet still effective.
A reduction of inflamation in the joints on the hands, feet and elbow.  The nature of taking one does per week was also very beneficial did not have to remember to take daily.
My skin was really red (I am very fair skinned) from using harsh products (Obagi) and benzyol peroxide. The redness started to improve within the first week. I just used a mild cleanser and the differin. I had less whiteheads the first two weeks as well but then had a purging period for a couple of weeks. My skin is defininately clearer now but not perfect. Did not help at all with oily skin.
Became addictive .. Docs never told anything that it should only be used very short term, less then two weeks!  The then become addictive. Not only that, the told me nothing of side affects, nor tolerance withdrawals, nor, you need to withdraw slowly.  These are very dangerous drugs, you my think it helps, but you will pay he'll being on any  benzodizapines.  If you don,t believe this, go towww.benzo.org read dr (prof) ashton,s Manuel.   You will suffer the depth of he'll if you don,t get off these.  .
Lower my blood pressure out of the Prehypertension range
I am not sure if it was levothyroxine that helped to normalise the hormone levels. It's kind of strange, as they've only were back in range, when i stopped taking l-thyroxine.
This pill is awesome!
Helped to alleviate allergic reactions to the environmental allergy agents.
I had no treatment benefits. Did not stop the sweating, but I started bleeding vaginally quite heavy. I hadn't had a period in 6 years. Then this happened. I also had some mild cramping like you get when your period is going to start. Bright red blood, some clotting as well. Went off of of prempro after 33 days. I am still bleeding but I have been told that this will stop now that I have stopped prempro........also I suggest you look online and get informed about the severe side effects........my doctor in the end stated that she would never take them........would have been nice if she told me this before I did and when she prescribed them for me.
The benefits are: helps acne and scarring, improves skin texture, heals acne quicker, and feels refreshing.
Cymbalta got me out of a major depression.  I am still taking it.  It also relieved my back pain for about 6 months but that good effect has diminished.  While I still am not the happiest camper, I am able to function normally.  I was not able to function before the cymbalta.  When I first got on it, I had extreme fatigue for several days and some "electric jolts"  when I was lying down.  However, that side-effect has gone.  It also causes some constipation, which is something I've rarely experienced!  I eat a very high-fiber diet but even so I'm not my "normal" regular self.   I'm writing this because of all the negative things I've read online.  If I had read them before I started the cymbalta I would not have gone it.  I'm happy I did not read anything!  I now feel that these reviews are written by  people with miserable results, or people who are incredibly impatient and expect and instaneous cure are the folks writing most reviews.
Ear infection is gone.
immediate relief from acute, severe post-surgical spinal pain following three-level lumbar fusion. minimized discomfort so that i was ambulatory, which was a key factor in my recuperation (physical movement was encouraged)
The prevention of pregnancy was the benefit in addition to almost completely eliminating a monthly menstrual cycle.  Other than that, there were no other benefits involved in taking this medication.  The benefits at the time that I was taking this drug outweighed the risks. However, at this time, the risks and side effects now outweigh the benefits.
Thicker hair shafts, darker hair color, stronger hair roots, less greying, halting of hair loss, fuller hair, more hair coverage, healthier looking hair.
reduced swelling so i could bend knee & do physical therapy. the healing on it's own was not happening as fast as 2nd dr. wanted. he said 1st. dr left leg brace on too long there fore muscles tightened up and therapy was very painful.
I didn't see any benefits, what else can I say? I had to take this to counteract the side effects of clindamycin.
The Femring is a vaginal ring containing estradiol that was effective in providing HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) thereby eliminating hot flashes, vaginal dryness and other menopausal effects.  The Femring is inserted vaginally so the estradiol is absorbed quickly into your skin.  It lasts three months which eliminates the need to take medicine daily.
They gave me a little more energy for the first week or two.  But then after that, no noticable increased energy was felt.  The first 3 days my hunger seemed to be less, but I think this was only due to a plecebo affect.
Xanax took the edge off of the anxiety without causing drowsiness or interfering with thought process. The anxiety was due to court testimony and memory recall of 5 years prior. Calendar dates were going to be of importance.
very firm erection around 20 minutes after initial dose. The 100 mg dose was considerably more efficacious than lower doses. The "firmness" of the erection is much more notable at 100 mg.
i had a calmer outlook in general and was able to cope with stressful situations better. Also little things that use to stress me out i was able to deal with.
removal of superfacial basal cell skin carcinomas without surgery
The imitrex I first took by giving myself shots, but now just take the 100mg tablets.  I no longer have migraines.  As soon as I feel a migraine start, I immediately take a tablet, and within an hour the headache had subsided.  No one should have to suffer with migraines anymore.
My dry cough and sinus infections were virtually eliminated.
perioral dermatitis disappear completely during the treatment, but occured again after 2 months. During that time I used only natural toothpaste with no flouride in it. I haven't used any cosmetics during the treatment, but I started using facial cream after a week when dermatitis disappered avoiding the area around the mouth. Continue taking 100mg a day for 40 days and I'll see.
A dramatic decrease in the level of depression and a great increase in a feeling of well-being and hope for the future.  There were also considerable cognitive benefits: thought processes speeded up, memory became stronger and intellectual creativity increased.  Also the constant fatigue that accompanied the depression decreased and this made possible an exercise program that increased energy and enjoyment of strenuous activities.  In addition my general and social anxiety decreased dramatically.
Daily anxiety lessened considerably. When stressful situations arise I am better able to handle them although I am still able to feel somewhat anxious which is good. I don't want to be a zombie with no feelings at all.
Zoloft made me feel considerably better, which is to say it decreased the severity and frequency of my "why me" or "I suck" bouts, but the underlying facts were still the same.
increased CD4 count,and lower viral load.
clear skin. limited break outs
None.  Had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects!
Took the medication for bladder infection.  Never missed a dose and took it for five days.  Infection subsided, but returned about 1 week later.  Would recommend a longer time period.
So far, I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac, as I'm employing CBT methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring.
I can now sleep at night and not during the day, although easily stressed these drugs have enabled me to carry out my daily routine with no day time sleeping.


I still would never attempt to work outside the house, the stress level would tip me over. I don't have panic attacks anymore unless a major confrentational situation arises.
This did nothing for my dry eyes, which cause me to have blurry vision at times.
There was a complete halt of pain in the foot, which was the most affected area with arthritis, within 3 weeks of use. Swelling of the foot was gone within 5 weeks.
I started to take euthyrox to treat my under active thyriod , my symtoms where hair loss , voice horsness and pains all over , at first I was advised to take 50 mg , but that did not do the trick and my endo upped my dossage 12.5 mg a month, so far my hair has stopped falling out, my voice is back to normal, and I can stay wake in day , and not so tired taking this medication changed my life
There were little to no benefits to using differin to treat acne.  while it may have helped exfoliation, it did little to treat current and to prevent future acne.  instead of differin, using a separate skin exfoliation product in addition to an over the counter acne treatment might have been more beneficial.  My acne worsened using Differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  I don't know if I completely buy this theory though I would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  Unfortunately, it did not.
Pristiq elevated mood and energy levels.
Slept through the whole night. Did not even get up to use the rest room.
THE BEST painkillers ever! Quite low dosage when it comes to the active substance used but it does work perfect. I like the fact that they come in two different dosages 200mg and 400mg. When taking this medicine I think that one should take ones weight and the severity of the condition that one wants to treat.
none!!!
i have a chronic sinusitis condition. my throat and vocal abilities get affected change of season . i took allegra to alleviate the condition on the prescription of a doctor.the condition improved slowly.
I really didnt lose any weight even though I cut my caloric intake. I stopped snacking and in general ate less and went for walks when possible
Mild improvement of symptoms, however the symtoms were not eliminated.  This required a second treatment of the antibiotic a month later.  Again the symtoms persisted.  A third tretament was taken 6 months later again.  This appeared to have eliminated any chronic symptoms.
The symptoms of the gastritis resolved completely within 12 hours after the first dose and were not experienced at all while on the treatment. There were no troublesome side effects compromising compliance. The once daily dose was also ameanable to comlpeting the course of treatment with ease.
disapearance of migraine headache
Easy to take, began noticing a difference within two weeks
None.  I had a bacterial infection accompanying my flu and there wasnt a single noticeable benefit.
Good I am able to walk better. My hips do not very much now.
Complete reduction in heartburn & reflux.
seizures dissipated
Before taking Xyrem I had to take a daily nap to feel refreshed. I had vivid hallucinations and I had to control my emotions.I would also get up to use the restroom approximately 10 times at night. Since i started taking Xyrem, I stopped taking those daily naps, no more hallucinations and I am able to laugh;cry more with less muscle weakness. Eventhough I only sleep for 6-7 hours max, I wake up feeling refreshed.
I found tramadol quite effective before and after surgey to reconstruct my knee (acl).
Prolonged sleep, less pain
My migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. There was a clear inverse correlation between my Neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin, fewer migraines)
For the most part, the pressure feeling I constantly had in my bladder went away.  Sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night.
The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  


Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 


The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.


I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  


Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money.
The major benefit of taking this medication was a decrease in the signs and symptoms of anxiety that I experience when in social situations. It prevents the elevation in heart rate that I normally get, as well as preventing dry mouth, sweaty palms, etc. As a result, I am much more able to focus on the task at hand.
the reduction in inflammation was so great that there was an overall systemic improvement of


edema resulting from a deeply toxic experience of mold exposure that disrupted my entire


system and made daily life vis a vis food very distresssing and included a taxed liver...the effects


of the inflammation reduction on a daily basis for 2 months calmed my system and provided relief


so that deeper healing could occur.
I noticed significant changes in the beginning.  After about 2 years, the dosage needed to be increased and is now at the max.  I am experiencing an ebb in effect and have no way to increase the dosage now.
It definitely reducded the anxiety that I had, it also helped with the occaisonal insomnia that I was having. It had a very good effect.
The acne cleared up for the most part for about 6 months to a year afterwards.  Then symptoms returned and there was no difference in the severity of the condition prior to treatment.
these drugs eliminated hot flashes;they also appeared to help with restlessness,sleeplessness and made it possible for the patient to live a 'normal'life as if menopause was not happening.
Can get a good nights rest and anxiety attacks are supressed. I have been able to lead a normal life and be successfull. I am doing my doctoral now in medical research and belief without Azor it would not be possible. I remember what my life was before Azor and am relieved to know it is behind me. I have been on it for years now, the benefits outweighs the disadvantages- I know Im addicted. Azor was and still is prescribed to me by my psychiatrist.
I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.
helped with acne and cysts even though not used daily as prescribed. Face was overall clearer over time. The best part was helping with pimples that formed into cysts.
the doctor told me that this medication would suppress my appetite as well as increasing my metabolic rate which would assist in weight loss.  As I only had to lose 10kg I am not sure that I was the best candidate.
I was told to avoid coffee, tea, chocolate & peppermint :'(  My hiatal hernia is tiny, but I feel fortunate that I was told about it before it got out of hand.  I feel 100% better 90% of the time, and when I don't, it's usually because I forgot to take my pill the previous day.  I would prefer for my pain to be treated by diet changes alone, but it's nice to have a pill to rely on.  It's my goal to control my pain naturally, wish me luck!
Easy to use. 


Highly effective.
After 2 weeks of continue use, there is less breakouts. The comedone is open and also fast healing.
The treatment results were successful.  The prescription took the pain away.
Started with Fluoxetine for 2 year befoe starting Strattera. Initial benefits: Feeling of urgency to complete work, Morefocus on details, Less emotional lability,Feeling in control, Less forgetting,Less anxiety, panic stopped completely, depressive moods disappeared appearing occasionally. Took once a week counselling ADHD dicussion groups before and during starteera therapy
I had tesiticular cancer, and I became addicted to OxyContin.  Try as I did, I simply could not kick the habit.  Methadone really worked for me, and after a while, I tapered at a slow rate.
Reduced pain caused by erythema, ability to carry out day to day activities without too much discomfort. Though tiredness was on of the side effects of the problem this could not be resolved with drugs, though blood tests did show whether the situation was improving or not.
Placebo effects, I thought it was helping at first
the drug was effective in reducing high thyroid hormone levels
At first I started with the 65 mg dose for about a month and it really helped my skin. All acne was reduced. I think during this first month though is when I started to build up reactors and an allergy to this medication.
Initially, I was concerned because I had knee surgery and was on crutches for six months.  I gained weight rapidly and didn't know why.  After taking a blood test, it was determined that my thyroid level was low.  Once taking the medicine, my blood tests came back ok, but the weight did not decrease as the doctor had said it would.
I am able to go along my day without sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose. It has alleviated my symptoms except for a slight cough.
none!!!!
The acne I had on my face in the t-zone area disappeared within a week.
I had felt so depressed over the diagnosis of my mothers terminal illness and after taking this medication for less than 2 months I noticed that I could control my emotions much better.
topamax was originally prescribed to eventually replace in part or totally the Elavil I was taking as sleep med.  Elavil and Effexor were thought to initiate cravings for carbohydrates that would lead to overeating and overweight.  I was taking 300mg Elavil each night.  The goal was to completely switch from Elavil to Topamax.  Topamax also had the added benefit of preventing migraines which I am prone to because of my hydrocephalis caused by a sub arachnoid cyst. I have a VP shunt
There were no benefits to me with this drug for treating cyclic vomiting syndrome. It did not stop the nausea or vomiting.
Helped releive the pain but not for long as the side effects come very quickly and made me feel much worse
My symptoms prior to taking the medication was the feeling of anxiety, sadness, I cried often and easily. After taking the medication I felt like I could cope with my problems and my day to day activity was more managable with what was happening with my personal life. I was told by my physician this medication could be taken long term if needed. I know some medication of this type can make you feel spacey. This medication had no effect like this on me whatsoever.
I was able to concentrate and complete daily tasks.  I didn't have to write notes to myself and constantly put them in various places so I would run into during the day.l
removed bacteria from a rather invasive surgery that could have encountered complications which could lead to other serious side effects
Less urinary urgency (worked as advertised).
It helped with the itchy watery eyes and congestion
Diminished sinus congestion/drainage and related cough. No hemoptysis or rust stained sputum noted after three days use of Levaquin. Throat irritation diminished third day. Increased feeling of wellbeing on third day.
According to thyroid tests that I take every year, the combination of levothyroxine and cytomel are keeping my hypothyroid under control.
Lower levels of sciatiaca pain. Light lifting of depression. Also helped slightly with anger
Depression eased, and was able to continue with daily life. Additionally, regular headaches eased and eventually disappeared.
This drug does an excellent job of relieving my headache pain.  No OTC drug comes anywhere near reducing the pain like this prescription does.  What I used to do for headache pain is lay down in a darkened room with an ice pack on my forehead.  If I could fall asleep usually the pain would be gone when I woke up.  Problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet, darkened room when a headache comes on.  This prescription relieves pain completely within 45 minutes.
Neurontin helped prevent hypomania and headaches.  Neurontin allowed me to feel less like I was aboard a runaway train.  I was able to back off enough so that I was able to move normally.  It also helped with the headache associated with a subdural hematoma.
My doctor prescribed Lexapro to treat my condition of Major Depression Disorder (MMD.)  In addtion to Major Depression Disorder, I also have Anxiety Disorder, and prior to treatment, I occassionally get into hyperventilation. I felt better after several days into taking Lexapro, and I was able to sleep better also.
inhibits allergic reactions
In short, the patient recovered. The patient sometimes used to report higher grades of Blood Pressure, anxiety and headache. Also reported to have back ache some times.


The present treatment gave patient comfort and she has recovered to a greater extent, and is able to live a normal life now.
What I really like about this medication is that it cleared up my sinuses. I no longer experience the tingling feeling that I had in my cheeks and around my lip area. I am also very happy that the medication helped me with my allergies to dust and to the effects of dry air on my nose. It stopped my nightly nose bleeds.
presumably my high colesterol was lowered as a result of taking this medication.
This drug after it reached therapeutic levels in my body resulted in a lifting of my depression. I was able to function in life in a more normal way. I "just felt like doing things". Before i was struggling to get things accomplished.
After several days of taking 20 mg. per day my signs of depression were gone. I felt coming out of the dark in the bright sun! It has changed my life.
My skin dried up and the acne went away. This was extremely effective.
I did not feel that the original diagnosis was correct. I went to the doctor for tooth pain and he chose to treat me for TMJ of which I disagreed. As it turned out the diagnosis was incorrect as I eventually had the tooth pulled and all pain stopped. I did not complete the suggested treatment plan due to mild side effects listed below.
Before tamsulosin, I was getting up to urinate from 3 to 6 times a night. Now I can sleep all throught he night without getting up to urinate!
After polypectomy, kept polyps from reforming to a large degree though I've never regained my sense of smell except for periodic whiffs of gasoline, etc.
ok so far no probs just the odd headache  i find the clonazapam lasts me about 7 to 8 hours is that about right for 1mg i dont no
was placed on ritalin due to extreme fatigue assosicated with fibromyalgia.


medication highly effective in overcoming lack of energy and the tiredness that would never seem to go away.


the fatigue was worse than the physical pain associated with fibromyalgia.
improved some symptoms: cold intolerance; carbs cravings; gives energy for a short periods of time (2-3 weeks) after increasing the dose;
Whenever I had a diarrhoea attack I could take two pills of the drug and the attacks diminished in numer and intensity, not blocking my intestinal activity afterwards
Clear skin is priceless, to wake ach day confidant, self esteem in tact and out the door with out "needing" makeup..I would do it again.
It cured the rash around my upper lip and chin area
this drug claims 99.9% accuracy when administered daily with very little side effects, have been using for several years with no weight gain and no accidents. the packaging is simple, easy and convenient.
It reduces the frequency of episodes of relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis.
Once I was diagnosed properly and began taking the synthroid, my dry skin cleared up, my energy level increased and my depression lifted.  My hair is now thick and shiny again.  I did not have weight gain so I cannot comment on that.
I was able to eat without nausea and vomiting after meals.  I was able to regain lost weight.  I was able to eat normal sized meals again.
After about two weeks of the taking Chantix the craving was alot less
well controlled seasonal allergies and improved breathing.  I was able to use this medicine for allergies but also noticed that my general breathing, especially while working out, also improved.  Years later I was diagnosed with reactive airway disease instead of asthma.  I had noticed I had a much harder time jogging during the seasonal changes until I started taking the Claritin.  Then running became much easier, so it now makes sense to me that the Claritin helped so much.
Nerve pain and muscle pain decreased significantly within the first couple days.  Fibromyalgia was very debilitating for me but with Lyrica, I was able to go back to work and function normally.  It helped with pins and needles, twitching, and muscle spasms.  It also seemed to help with some of the anxiety I experienced.
Was getting up to urinate 3-6 times a night to urinate. NOw can sleep through the night getting up not at all or one time. excellent results - could not be happier. Dr. did digital exam, but felt no abnormality, but said hypertrophy could be on side he could not palpate, so to try tamsulosin. It worked!
The benefits to the treatment were that my anxiety was significantly decreased.  It took almost two months for the benefits to kick in, but when they did it was well worth it.  The depression also decreased significantly.  I'm not sure if that was due to the addition of Wellbutrin, or if the reduction in anxiety was so great as to reduce the depression.
Strength returning, clarity, ability to breath improved
the treatment was to help lower my colesterol levels, i only took it for two weeks so i did not benefit from taken this treatment,
My chlamydia went a way and i made a complete recovery. My acne also temporarily went away, which was good. However, it did come back after i stopped taking it, which meant it was somewhat useless.
The treatment remedied her lab values as well as treated her symptoms of weight gain and lack of energy.
More energy, the pall that was hanging over me was lifted.  I became me again.  I did not just cruise through life having no connection, I was engaged again.
this drug lowered my mild hypertension to normal range
Stopped thinking that caused panic attacks and delusions. Helped me be able to parent effectively again.
The benefits were simple--NONE
lowering high cholesterol
It helped with menstrual pain and cramping due to utereine fibriods. It also slowed down heavy menstraul bleeding somewhat that was caused by the size, number and location of my uterine fibriods.
A muscle in my neck was pinching a nerve such that  if i turned my head or lay on that side my arm would instantly start to tingle and my hand fall asleep.  The Flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes, and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely.
When I am in highly stressful situations, I start to cry.  I took xanax at times when I knew this would happen and it worked perfectly.  I did not cry at all, my eyes didn't even water.  This has never happened with any other medication.
I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.
much more effective than synthroid in raising body temperature, relieving fatigue, and weight loss
This medication was greatly effective in alleviating my depression, more effective than SSRIs or SNRIs I have tried.  Also, the effects did not seem to wear off with time (over the course of treatment, 9-12 months) which I experienced with celexa and effexor xr.  The facial pain was also decreased, this medication is also used as a treatment for nerve pain.
Wellbutrin has been very effective for my low-grade depression. I have tried many other antidepressants in the past and have found them to be ineffective and/or causing too many side effects (weight gain, sexual side effects, fatigue, etc.). Wellbutrin actually helps me maintain my weight and has minimal sexual side effects.
Prevented pregnancy
Swelling decreased. Itching stopped. Easy to calculate dosage. Familiarity of rx with patient and family.  IV push med. Rapid acting.
The doctor gave me a shot of cortazone.that quickly reduced . I was sent for therapy for about ten visits. I was also prescribed celebrex. However the celebrex actually made me feel worse. My heart was racing and it hurt my throat when I swallowed. It felt like I had a marble logged in my throat.my blood pressure was sky rocketing. The pain was gone but I felt terrible.
I slept wonderfully well.
Crestor reduced my LDLC dramatically. Unfortunately there is no evidence that Crestor reduces heart attack risk or other cardiac event or reduces plaques. Stents and bypasses have not been proven to promote longevity either - merely to alleviate discomfort. 


My blood pressure went as low as 80/40 which made me faint
Helps to get patient to sleep more quickly than any other sleep aid; no morning "grogginess" as with some other medications.
The treatment benefits were of a great benefit to me. before i took the lortab i couldn't sleep, work, and i could barely get out of bed the pain was so severe. Before the lortab i did try the flexeril first and it didn't help, then I tried it with the Lyrica that only dulled the pain a little. Then the lortab and it helped tremendously. I started on two times a day after a month went to three and it helped to the point where i could work and I could get out of bed and do things like cut the grass or hiking and just many of other things. My overall experience were tremendous with minimal side effects!!!!!
Since this was an initial diagnosis of HSV 2 I do not know how effective it was as I have nothing to compare it to.  It is supposed to keep HSV 2 from erupting on the skin's surface or if it already has, it is supposed to reduce the duration of the lesions.
By taking Yasmin I did not get pregnant, as it did act as a proper birth control method.  However the side effects outweighed the benefits and I was forced to switch to a new form of birth control. I would NEVER recommend this type of birth control.
This particular treatment effectively eliminated all visible symptoms of oral herpes.  In my case, the symptoms were increasingly worse.  I would have an outbreak every two months that would last 14-18 days.  Since treatment, I have not had one outbreak.  Two years and counting.
general gradual lowering of cholesterol levels over a period of twelve months
The tamoxifen has kept my condition (benign) constant and with no signs of maligancy developing for ten years since the discovery of the condition.  Levothyroxine raised my levels to normal and I am less fatigued and feeling generally healthy.
After pregnancy my upper lip remainedmarked with dark spots - melasma. My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles.
Prior to taking Nexium I had continuous GERD.  I took every type of antacid over the counter.  In addition I had more episodes of Asthma and cystitis.  Whenever I had extreme heartburn I would also get the other 2 problems mentioned above.
There was a complete reduction of back pain, and the inflammation. I wasn't sure what was causing it at the time- ie. back strain or period pain or?? but the Voltaren made me able to walk and sit comfortably again
The paxil ,valium combination releived my symtoms.
I now lost 6 kg during 3 months and I can now wear my favorite dress without any hassles.
after being given this treatment there was no coughing no vomitinig like i had experienced with some other bp medication
I had become so severly depressed that I was incapable of holding a job.  My doctor had tried virtually all classifications of meds on the market but none were able to pull me out of the state I was in.  My world had become so dark I felt the sun would never shine again.  This med allowed me to function again within my family and within the working world.  I stopped crying all the time and was able to concentrate and perform the tasks necessary for employment.  I got my life back.
Prevention of post surgical infection and peace of mind following my minor outpatient surgery.
Nasonex helped me brath at night and stopped congestion, sneezing and running nose.


It helped me also with my cat allergy, so now I have 3.


For years before nasonex I used dexarhinasray very often (5-6 times per week) but now I use it 10 times per year! in order to stop sneezing and running nose.
None
i had a severe fall and tore the psoas muscle and damaged the SI joint. Before i was in great physical shape. After I could barely walk a block. After PT which only mildly helped I asked for various meds. Vicodin helped some but left me hung over. Valium released the muscle seizures and allowed me slowly to   return to exercise. It's not used much now that there's Flexeril, but F. can lead to depression and doesn't as effectively release muscle tension (in my case).
It cleared the skin infection,effectively and quite fast, was convenient to take, and easy to remember.
It removes boyh visible a nd unseen sun damage from the skin
For the depression it didn't make much of a difference; but it worked wonders for my anxiety. The edginess, nervousness, impatience, fear of socializing and going out of the house, completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed, when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist, we came to that conclusion.
None (see next entry).
control glacoma; since drug was so expensive, eye doctor started me out with sample drops. Drug was being used to stem the development of glacoma.
The drug melts on the tongue so there is no need for water and is great when you need to take a tablet in the car etc. It is effective as soon as the effects of a migraine appear and I would reccommend it to anyone who suffers.
The drug is supposed to help decrease tear production. My eyes are still dry and get irritated easily. However, they are better than before I started the drug. On the ocassions when I have stopped using it for 2-3 weeks, my symptoms worsen, so it does appear to be helping.
,being able to smoke while drug builds up in your system, I also really enjoyed the colorful and vivid dreams but some people are known to have terrible nigjhtmares.   Also you really do completely  Lose the urge to smoke!
None-Well, my TSH is only .02, but my thyroglobulin levels are elevated as well as antibodies. So...MAYBE this helped keep the cancer down (over the years I've had multiple I-131 treatments, 33 IMRT or external beam radation treatments, and multiple surgeries to the neck region. The drug does NOT seem to help with the symptoms that were evidence since realizing I had thyroid cancer.
After skin finally healed - treatment areas were improved.
Skin irritation and dandruff were eliminated after third use.
My skin looked a little better but no significant improvement in wrinkles.  I  called the company and they said I should try it every second night.  I did that for a few months and did not get any result.  No peeling and flacking and still no significant difference in my wrinkles
helped with anxiety.
The treatment benefits were the initial complaint of monthly cycle depression and nervousness went from occurring for a ten to fourteen day period down to a two day  


time frame.  Monthly menstruation also occurred in a more timely fashion - every 28 days.
After a couple of years of Propecia taking, I stopped loosing hair on the top of my head, moreover, it seems that hair got a little bit more dense, although I am not sure if this is just a feeling or a fact. It didn't improve my hairline in the temples though.

I sometimes wake up refreshed although with xyrem I only sleep for about 5 hrs every night
The treatment benefit was that my fever went down. My tonsilitis was also cured. After seven days or even less I was already feeling better. One benefit is that the cure can be taken orally with no downtime. It did not cause any side effects but sped up my recovery.
I was able to quit smoking 2 1/2 yrs ago.  I had smoked 2 1/2 packs of menthols for 35 years.  No one,including me, thought I could ever quit.  The Chantix kept me from feeling any withdrawal from nicotine and made it so smoking didn't give me the "boost" it had.  There became no point in smoking.  I kept the last prescription to take "PRN' when in certain situations.  It also took a little mental work.
I believe that there are multiple treatment benefits of Taking Tylenol for my headache. Tylenol is safe, inexpensive, and does not require a physicians prescription. Additionally, it is available almost everywhere and therefor is convenient.
I experienced markedly improved fasting blood glucose levels, and greater stability of blood sugar before and after meals.  I had found with other treatment options, such as the insulin pump and the nph insulins that my morning blood sugars were always high, even with increased dosages.
Ejection Fraction increased from 27% to 55% over period of 8 years. No longer have chest pain, congestive heart failure, difficulty breathing, can do almost anything I want to.

I was prescribed this medicine by my neurologist who prescribed it to treat both seizures and migraine headaches. The medicine was very effective. In the 6 month period I was on the medicine, I only experienced 3 seizures compared to my normal 3 a week. Migraine headaches were also reduces, only apparent if triggered by something severe.
The treatment benfits were...I was able to over come depression with assitance from the drug paxil.  Along with therapy and Paxil I was able to live a normal life till I was able to do it alone through the coping methods I learned in Therapy.  I had no side effects and paxil took the edge off and allowed me to work ont he issues subjectively.
On day two of taking prempro at 5pm, I felt the extreme crashing fatigue and weakness go away! I felt a calmness in my nerves and I no longer had hot flashes, my skin was actually cold to the touch. The underarm body odor that had occured out of nowhere, so bad I had to wear my husbands deoderant, that also went away immediatly. Energy level increased and the all over illness I felt went away.  Thank God!
Eliminated cystic acne
The medication did provide some lessening of allergy symptoms.  It helped my nose not to water as much.  However, I still had congestion and some days where my allergies were quite uncomfortable.  It seemed the effects lessened as time went on so the medication was less effective than at the beginning. Also my eyes still itched.  My throat also itched.
mild facial improvement, healing was faster. Problem persisted. Problem increased upon ceasing of the medication.
My face and back acne cleared up within two weeks of regular use

Decreasse in general anxiety symptoms and most symptoms of depression.
The medicine did not work on her head  ache--she had it all day long.
The famotidine has pracically eliminated the hives in conjunction with the Doxepin. I am now down to 20 mg of famotidine a day - I just take it in the evening. The next step will be to start taking it just every other day until I am off it completely. We'll monitor the hives alont the way, of course.
I didn't get any blackheads, and my cystic acne was considerably reduced. If a I started getting a giant underground pimple, it would clear up in a week. Without treatment, it could take a month or two to go away.
Increased energy, ability to focus, and increased ability to lose weight.  Patient suffered fewer low blood sugar episodes.  Thirty pounds of weight were lost in the first year.

Stopped suicidal thoughts, stopped my constant worrying , my mind felt at peace for the first time in my life
There seemed to be some mild improvement in alertness once he went onto the stronger (10 mg) version of the pill. There was no noticeable improvement in mood which was a disappointment.
I found that the benefits of this drug were marginal at best. My heart rate decreased and I felt slightly less anxious but I still had a feeling of unease especially during social situations. Social situations felt only barely tolerable.  Though symptoms were minimized slightly it wasn't worth the side effects.
I had no benefits from this medication, if anything it added more problems for me. It never once relieved my pain in my ankle. Darvacet helped my ankle more then this medication. Even though I was switching because Darvacet was losing its effectiveness it would have been tons better to stay on Darvacet for all the bad Tramadol did for me.
There was a slight softening of the verticle wrinkles between my eyebrows, or "11" lines, but not the degree of change I was looking for, or had been suggested was possible by my physician, even after the second treatment.
there were very few side effects plus after 3 days I was able to breath again.  It did take at least seven days before I could breath properly all the time. I did finish all the medication as my dr. prescribed.

The fluticasone propionate shrinks the polyps when used as directed. The smaller the polyps the better one can breath; also the irritation from the polyps is reduced.
The treatment benefits was better looking healthier skin
I would have wondering thoughts, like way to often, just thinking about the best ways to improve my lot in life, until it started to consume me to much. So I sought help, the main problem was sleeping, my thoughts would race so hard, that I could not sleep, this drug put my thoughts in check, allowing me to sleep soundly.
I was finally able to easily fall asleep and for the most part remain asleep for the entire night. The sleep was more refreshing and I woke up without the typical sleeping pill "hang-over".  Even while falling asleep you I didn't feel like I was all of a sudden blind-sided by a brick wall and forced to sleep.  This feels much more natural and real than other medications I have tried.
no hot flashes and decrease in night sweats
my throat was better.  My headache started to pass away quite fast. At the end of the third day, with the help of the other medication I took during the treatment, I was healthy and could go to work.
A very bad and large cold sore started to slowly go away immediately when started.  I started it because my cold sore wasn't going away and getting way worse.  So I was prescribed 200mg 4x a day, for 10 days.  Which it immediately kept the cold sore from getting worse. I was give another same perscription and kept taking it, then my doctor wouldn't give me any more, even though it was showing improvement.  So, I found that I could order it online, and it directed me to take 1600 mg during outbreaks, so I did.  And it started healing, and now after almost a month it's almost gone.  This cold sore didn't break the surface, but was getting larger so this medication was a life saver.
Decreased the acidity in stomach.
I had a kidney infection with a very high fever.  Cipro reduced the fever from 104.2 to 97.6 within 5 or 6 day/cured the kidney infection..
Non that were apparent.
It lowers blood pressure from 100/150 to 85/130 and it also helps eliminate excess  fluids which made me very bloated. Now when I wake up in the morning my eyes are not that swollen. Also my heart seems to work without much effort. Before I felt my heart pumping hard and now I can't hardly feel it.
Although I had mild sleep problems the first two days of taking Vyvanse, I had virtually no side effects. Granted, my dose was low, but I had a hard time concentrating and summoning up the energy to do basic things like paying bills, etc. Vyvanse is no wonder drug, but I live pretty much like everyone else now, which is great. My mother is stunned. She says this is the first time she's ever been able to ask me where things are in my apartment and have me know (and be right). I take a medication holiday from Vyvanse most weekends and actual work holidays when I don't need to be able to concentrate.
Extremely effective for staying awake.  No jitters, just plain awake.  Puts you in a great mood too, but definitely not high.
O TOOK THIS TO HELP TO RELIEVE AND CURE MY YEAST INFECTION.  I HAD TRIED SEVERAL OTHER CREAMS, ONE WAS OVER THE COUNTER THE OTHER WAS PRESCRIBED BY MY DOCTOR.  THIS ORAL MEDICATION WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKED.
becoming a normal functioning individual. it helped with the worry or feelings of anxiety. when diriving not being overwhelmed and felling confident. able to go in stores and be around people. not feeling tired or other types of side effects associated with anxiety drugs. not addictive, unlike other drugs. eventually i was able to stop taking the drug for a full recovery
My bleading slowed.
Hard to judge whether or not it was actually reducing the inflammation.  I was taking it while undergoing physical therapy which seemed at times to exacerbate the pain from the whiplash.
My severe pain and joint swelling diminished soon, and I have had few painful moments (and nothing like the pain I had before my diagnosis).
BETTER SLEEP- WELL RESTED
Highs and lows of emotions were evened out.  Able to get through difficult crises without "falling apart".
I had been on Quasense (a generic for a different type of extended BC) and liked it a lot but I noticed when I would go off the pill (for period) I would get extreme migraines when my hormones fluctuated.  Switched to Seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  Nope.  After the first three months I had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  I gave it three more months but had the same results.  The good news?  Not pregnant.
The benefits to the treatment was temporary relief of pain due to unknown infection in jaw area. Though no other drugs were taken to address the infection, the prescribed drug did alleviated the pain until the condition improved. Eventually a root canal was performed and I received a second prescription.
I was able to reduce my smoking completely when taken as prescribed.
I was able to function until later in the day, without needing a nap
As having surgery, my mounth experienced excruiating pain. I was without them for 3 hours. These seemed like the worst day of my life. After taking the pills I noticed one of two things occured. One, the pain was gone soon after taking them. Two, I became extremely tired. First I thought that it was only like this because I just had surgery, but no. It seemed as though everytime I taken a pill I needed a nap soon after. Don't get me wrong, I would rather have a nap and be painless then to be awake throughout the entire day and experience that pain. This stayed this way for the entire time that I was on Lortab.
Mum is notably brighter and more responsive whilst taking Aricept.  On mornings when tablets are forgotten (or inadvertantly dropped) she is much less alert and therefore alot more challenging to care for (less likely to be able to perform tasks she usually can perform herself)
lowered cholesterol
She did not seem to have much benefit from it.  She still had considerable gas & acid reflux.
Helped my abdominal pain and bowels. A little more energy after the first infussion but not much after the rest.  Helped with fistulas.
reduced symptoms after using the cream for a total of two months.
Most nights I am able to fall asleep within about 20 minutes, sleep through the night, and wake feeling refreshed.  I do not feel any residual tiredness or sluggishness during the day.
The patient did wake up more refreshed in the morning and didn't have to take the usual hour - 2 hour naps after work.  They didn't feel tired during the day anymore
None
cleared up nose
I really don't know if there are any, since I'm taking it prophylactically.
Vicodin 500mg- reduced bone pain caused by Neulasta shot.


Dexameth 4mg.- reduced drug reactions caused by chemotherapy.


Compazine 10mg.- reduced nausea caused by chemotherapy.


Taxotere/Cytoxan- going thru tx. at this time. hope to be cancer free!


Neulasta shot- increased whit blood count so we could continue with chemotherapy.
I was able do my work without hassles and I'm free from pain right now. There's no need for me to cry anymore whenever I urinate.
Hardly any- it was much less effective than paracetamol against the pain. I still had to take the maximum dose of ibuprofen to reduce the pain. I hoped taking Voltaren as well would extend the analgesic effects of the ibuprofen but it was fairly ineffective.
This  slows the sugar going into my system so that my body can use most of my own insulin to process the sugar.  It is to be taken along with the metformin. It has helped control my blood sugar very well.
I have only been taking it 2 weeks but it so far eliminated my night sweats and hot flashes and in just 2 weeks I have noticed my skin looks and feels like I am 20 again my slight wrinkles on my face vanished almost overnight I look and feel younger. I am so impressed with my complexion.
in taking finasteride 2.5mg per day for six months i noticed an increase in hair growth of new hairs and existing ones. most of the increased hair growth was in the crown region of the head. There was an increase  of hair growth of the front hair line, but it was not substantial. My hair also grew at a faster rate than normal.
no pregnancy, reduced ance
The benefit is that it cleared up the giardia infection I had.
This treatment helped with my rheumatoid arthritis as I had decided not to take any stronger drugs anymore.  I attribute my being able to function on just one a day to my taking of many supplements, i.e. fish oils, MSM, Vit C, E and so forth.  I also do Tai Chi and try to stay as active as I can.  So far, so good!!
drug was prescribed for off label use to treat recurrent infections by physician whose protocol addresses high viral load in limbic system (chicken pox) and GI tract (MMR vaccine remnants).  It seemed to work - could be that other environmental variables were removed simultaneously but I can't think of variables that were exactly concurrent with taking of this drug.  It stopped 6 week recurrent symptoms of cold/flu-like exhaustion.
Much greater ability to breathe.
Before when I had a migraine headache I used to be in agony for at least 48 hours. I would have to go to bed because the pain was so bad. I could hardly see and my stomach would be so upset that I would be sick to my stomach. Nothing that I tried ever worked. With the zomig, usually within 1-2 hours and sometimes less I would have tota relief of my migraine headache.
the treatment reduced the following symptoms of depression: apathy, lack of


interest in daily activities, passive suicidal ideation, loss of energy.
More energy, better mood, increase sexual desire (which was very low).
Ear pain decreased on the third day.  Ear pain was gone by the day 5. Both infections went away on the 6th day.  This drug worked as expected and the results were remarkable.
I can not shut my mind down to go to sleep.  I will lay there and think of thing after thing and cannot "shut down." I originally took ambien for insomia, but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  My doctor put me on trazadone as a safe, low cost alternative.  I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a trazadone each night. I vary the dosage, depending on how "excitable" I feel that day. It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway, I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone.
The immediate benefits were the relaxing, pain free life I am now experiencing. I am not sure how long it will last, but I will take the relief for now. I have suffered with terrible back pain for going on 8 years, and until I was prescribed valium and Norco combination, I was still in excruciating pain. The combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. When I awake, I am hurting, but within 20 minutes of taking meds, I am my old, 25 year old self again.
For over a period of several years my blood pressure has gone down and has stayed down. Follow up visits to the doctor have proven to be much better when blood pressure was checked. The doctor has recommended that I stay on this product and along with exercise should be highly effective.
Severe debilitating pain  associated with inflammation and joint pain through out the body is alleviated, enabling more normal living.  eg being able to do all housework tasks, gardening, running around and picking up grandchildren, enjoying social life plus taking part in daily fitness activities.
No seizures
Analgesic post surgery without use of codeine (patient has allergy).
Perfect.  The Trazadone helps me sleep inspite of the Prozac.  I no longer have any manic phases thanks to Lamictal.
Has brought BP down to 128/85
The benefits were smoother, more evenly-colored skin. I have no deep wrinkles. I developed no blemishes and I tended to stay out of the sun since it makes skin photo-sensitive. I am mistaken for being younger than my age, however, whether it's heredity or product, I'll never know for sure.
I have been struggling with adult acne. A dermatologist prescribes the Minocycline and for the first two months, it worked great. I had perfectly clear skin AND I noticed that my hair STOPPED falling out at it's normal rate. All the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are 60, wigs are definitely in order. Also, I normally get tonsil stones. These also ceased.
getting rid of a migraine after years of suffering. Have lost count of the ruined parties, weddings, holiday days etc before a friend recommended this tablet to me. To me it is simply a magic pill.
Controlled allegies very well
Very concentrated , very alert , Euphoria , more done in less time , sociable , energetic .
Effexor was very effective at alleviating my symptoms of depression.  My mood improved dramatically, I felt happy and engaged in life again.  It also worked fairly quickly.  I began feeling the effects within the first week.
None - No pain relief
No fluctuation anymore. Normal bloodpressure ever since
lightening of acne scars
The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however.
ALL my anxiety, stress, were gone. I also have Tourette's Syndrome, which is a neurological disorder which causes me to have involentary movements and sounds that I have no controll over, (tics.) And once I started taking this medicine, the tics were such at the minimum, i used to have 50-100 tics a day, now i have 3-4 tics all because of Lorazepam. This might be a very good treatment for others with Tourette's Syndrome!!
effective in helplng to control acid reflux
I just finished my 90 day course and am seeing great benefits.  My toenails are finally growing out thin and clear.  I didn't start to see any major changes in my toenails until around the two month mark.  I told myself I would be one of the people who comes back to review the product because the positive reviews I read are what got me through those first few weeks when all of the negative side effects were flashing through my head.  It has definitely been worth it to take the pills.  I can't wait for a few more months to go by where my toenails will be completely  be grown out and I will feel confident about going and getting the first pedicure of my life.  Also very much looking forward to sandal season next year.
I've used 40mg Inderal for situational anxiety a few times per month over the past 6 years. I found it to be very effective when taken 30min to 1hr prior to public speaking, large social gatherings, dates, and other anxiety provoking situations. It really helps decrease signs of nervousness resulting from the fight-or-flight response, such as increased heart rate, sweaty palms, and dry mouth.
treatment benefits of using amoxicillin for the infection proved to be substantial. My infection diminished progressively over the course of a week taking the prescribed dosage each day, I also noticed that the infection never reoccurred and has not since. Overall taking amoxil was not nearly unpleasant as I thought it would have been and it did the job I was told it would do
I had experienced decreased energy and increasing tiredness for several years.  It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child, and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical, my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately, my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks, I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all, darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower.
The benefits of amoxicillin were that it did help clear the infection, it seemed to help my acne, also.  I noticed it working within about four days.  I only had to take it for a week.  It did not taste bad.  It did not make me foggy headed.
Over the course of about three to four months of daily use, lifelong allergies started to decrease and then disappear altogether.
I have a background of worry and stress-related symptoms where I am unable to wind down at the end of the day. With this drug I am able to fall asleep within 30 minutes
my migraines would always leave after taking imitrex or sumatriptan and then if taken at night i could go back to sleep and sleep through the night and wake feeling just fine.
This drug did have benefits in that it stabilized my mood somewhat. I still suffer from severe bouts of depression- mostly caused by the side effects of the drug.
Once the side effects wore off, I was left with much smoother skin, and less acne.  I noticed a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, and an overall better texture to my skin.
The valium was prescribed for the patient in an attempt to relieve anxiety prior to a minor surgery being performed.
Remission of Crohn's Disease.  Remission included normal bowel movenments from about 15/day to 1 or 2 per day. Cramps associated with diarrhea have disappeared. Increased energy, feeling active and generally feeling better.  Endoscopy was done at one point after the treatment and there was indication of only very mild disease so basically remission was achieved according to my gastroenterologist.
None apparent during treatment.
Not much at all for what I had going on
Lamictal stopped my seizures as well as Epilim, but it gave me a considerate amount of energy.  Some would see it as a benefit to not have an appetite, even though it's bad for your health to not eat.  My depression went away with Lamictal.  Even when I had an appetite I still wouldn't eat much, which helped me greatly, since Epilim gave me terrible cravings.
This is the best migraine medication on the market. Imitrex no longer works for me. I cannot be without maxalt or I will be in the ER. When I took Imitrex, I would have to repeat the dosage every 8-10 hours for 3 days. But, with Maxalt, I take one dose and it lasts for the whole migraine and I never have to take another dose until the next migraine.
The medications has slowed down hair shedding but not prevented hair loss. Hair loss is still ongoing, miniturization of hair follicles is still ongoing.
My skin is now smoother with less acne.  I still get a pimple here and there, but for the most part, my skin has been very clear.
Was supposed to wait 10 days before attempting to quit 100%. The urge to smoke lessened significantly from first day.  Went from smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day to about 5-10 the first day.  By the end of the first week a was smoking 1 or 2 a day.  Quit before the 10 days were up.  1.5 years later, I am still not smoking.
I noticed firmer, more toned skin and a decrease in the appearance of fine lines on my face, especially around the eye area.
The rash and itch were suppressed after 2 days, and gradually the rash disappeared over the course of 7 days.
I took lamectal to replace Lithium hoping it will help stabilize my mood.  But after two years of taking it, it did not seem working.
my cholesterol is well controlled now.blood test show my cholesterol is under control now. down from 6.5 to 3.6
My son attends a preschool with many mulberry trees on the grounds.  These trees drop large amounts of pollen right on the children during parts of the year.  He would begin to itch all over and develop red splotches on his face.  The pediatrician prescribed Singular each night and it has alleviated all his symptoms.
Some relief from social anxiety. Really, no other benefits were found.
My acne was significantly reduced. My doctor added the oral medicince because using topical acne medications did not slow the acne pimples. My face only improved while using birth control pills, Doryx, and the topical acne medications.
None.
Pregnancy prevention, regulation of menstrual cycle.
The treatment benefits for Renova are more skin clarity.  Also, i believe the freckles on ;my face are fading quite a bit.  The fine lines did not really get any better. My skin is not really that different to notice real changes
The drug worked exactly as prescribed; my anxiety was reduced. Heart palpitations were lessened in frequency and running thoughts were ceased. I was able to fall asleep more quickly because I wasn't as consumed by worries. In fact, I found myself able to do things that before I wasn't able of doing, like having conversations with irritating family members.
The benefits were immediate relief from a "racing heart" or tachycardia caused by anxiety. I use this medicine prophylactically and found that it is very effective in controlling my heart rate and keeping it within a normal range. The only time it does not work is if I have a full-blown panic attack. At that point, other types of medications are used in addition to the atenolol.
Treatment benefits involved bringing the thyroid function tests into the normal range to counteract the hypothyroid condition that someetimes occurs in post-menopausal women.
Started to fell seasonal depression clear with about a week.
to lower cholesterol
The sinus infection lessened but did not go away.  I noticed that using a neti pot for a nasal flush worked much better.
Lipitor did lower my total cholesterol count, triglycerides, and bad cholesterol as well as raising my good cholesterol.  I was happy with the results.
Through taking this medication i basically have a stress free life. Being bi polar is crazy crazy stuff. I take 80mg of citalopram every night and wake up every morning able to function and care for my three children. Structure and routine is looking very possible. I now only have a flat day once every few weeks.
The treatment cleared up papules and pustules (not completely, but significantly) and decreased redness in the face.
There was no chance of pregancy because i lost 100 percent of my libido. My skin cleared up for the most part.
This drug was prescribed because my daughter has had adverse side effects from penicillin based antibiotics (trunk rash/hives from amoxicillin for an ear infection). She had a sinus infection that we couldn't get rid of with natural remedies (salt water flush, tea, elevated sleeping) so we went the antibiotic route.
The Spironolactone has really helped my acne, especially the huge flare ups I'd have monthly with my period.  I do still occasionally have break outs, but they are usually less severe, shorter lasting, and confined to my face.
Amerge is effective in reducing the pain and associated symptoms of migraines.
they were like a magic tablet
the treatment drastically reduced my anxiety and feelings of stress and panic during my PMS week.
Eased vaginal dryness for more comfortable intercourse.  Probably has a beneficial effect on my heart condition, since there is heart related problems in my family of origin.
NO LONGER ANY KNEE SWELLING.....TOTAL KNEE MOBILITY... NO PAIN...
There was a small reduction in my hot flashes but the side effect was bothering me too much to stay on the patch longer to see if it would have totally eliminated them over time.
I have terrible headaches that nothing ever helped, until zomig.  it has been a miracle drug for me.
my skin appeared smoother after an initial rough period with the start up of the product...fine lines seem to diminish and overall my skin seemed less sallow and more even toned....although, because of the continuing side effects it's difficult to stick with a consistent application
Well, I did not have an appetite all day.  But then at night, I was very hungry.  I only lost about 2 pounds in the week I took it.
Definately helps control the urge to smoke.  Was able to make it through the first week of no smoking with VERY CONTROLABLE urges.
lost weight very fast then mantained it for 4 years.
Lessened anxiety,brought about more attention
It reduced the tingling sensation, and numbness feeling in the effected part,it also acted on reducing stress levels. I found it as a last resort because for 3 years before that my life was very painful cause of the nerve damage, that I suffered during a Mucocele removal. I took the anti anxiety drug for 2 years and its side effect that it blocks nerve communication helped a lot, and thx god after 5 years i am cured, my nerve healed.
I have had Herpes Zoster or VZV all my life. Acyclovir completely eliminates the headache and flu like symptoms. If I take it early enough it stops all outbreaks in one or two days. If taken late; I need a higher dose and it can eliminate blisters in 2 or three days. My outbreaks were once or twice a year and I only used acyclovir cream. Now it appears less than once a year and can be stopped with Zovirax(Acyclovir).
Shortened duration of herpes outbreak.
Slight anxiety reduction but minimal.
Facial swelling reduced dramatically over 3 days, only to return (less so) as a side effect.  I could have just taken Benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), I would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.  Since then I've learned that some physicians are quite blas� about the side effects of prednisone -- apparently that old adage about "first do no wrong" is no longer important.
I am able to stay awake while driving.  I am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  My concentration is clearer.  It's not habit-forming because I could live without it.  It's just that I can not function without it.  I can't drive, or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.  With the provigil, along with my other medications, I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also, I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming.
relieved headache 99% of time, headaches did not recur for at least 18 hours
no more anxiety
This treatment was easy and highly effective. Adderall increased my overall energy levels, making it easier to get going in the morning and stay awake during classes. It increased my ability to pay attention even when the material was not particularly interesting to me. The most important benefit for me was the increased ability to control my impulses.
It greatly reduced the loss of hair in shower/on pillow in the morning.  There has been no sign of balding on top of head, and no progression on the temples.
I saw absolute no change in my rosacea so can claim no benefits.
The drug was prescribed for pain, and it worked to dull post op pain.
Tretinoin, used in conjunction with the Obagi regimen, greatly reduced facial hyperpigmention which was due to hormones and sun damage.
reduced the pain and swelling
Eliminated or reduced symptoms of anxiety - eliminated heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Provided a general feeling of calm.
The treatment completely eliminated all annoying menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and anxiety.  I no longer wake up at night with these symptoms and can sleep soundly through the night once again.
There were no noticable changes with selegiline, it was prescribed to help focus and attention for TBI.
The numbness in my arms and hands significantly reduced. I was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness, crying and even thoughts of suicide.  Taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well.
The amoxicillin got rid of my tooth infection very quick
Not much improvement in hormonal acne.
Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.)
The main benefit is the ability of the drug to reduce, even eliminate the panic attacks. The general mood is positively improved.
Treatment benefits included a correction of my T3, but only a mild improvement in my emotional status. I am still irritable and mildly depressed.
The benefits of taking Effexor are wonderful. My mood has been so much better. I can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. I have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems.
none
Adderall helps to clear my mind. It helps me finish work that I have already begun. It also reduces anxiety in social situations.
The drug did absolutely nothing for the pain or to lessen the time of the migraine.  The migraines were usually sseveral days long.
The benefits were a very gradual reduction in the appearance of sun spots on the skin. The spots themselves never disappeared but lightened over a period of time. The general appearance of the skin also improved slightly but it did not prevent new spots from appearing as I noticed that they did, although I suspect that the cream probably kept them lighter than they would have been. Discontinuation did make the darkness come back into the sun spots after about 4 to 6 months however.
Most often the diazepam got me to sleep fairly quickly but did not last the whole night through.  The liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie, 40 mins instead of 20. The benefit was there if I was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep.
less astma attacks 


do more excerie without getting tired to quick


focus more
Didn't get pregnant


Clear skin


Light periods
Truly allows me to function.  I work in a mentally demanding and stressful job.  Without this medication, I would not be able to work, let alone do much of anything else.
After 2-3 weeks complete abatement of panic attack symptoms.  After one year tried to stop taking them but within 3 weeks symptoms were back.  continued for two more years and stopped taking them.  Have not had any symptoms for @10 years now
Fiorinal almost always gets rid of my migraine headaches.
Lightening of dark spots that I experienced on both of my cheeks from melasma. I noticed definite results within weeks; however, with only short periods of accidental sun exposure the dark spots would reappear. Make sure to use sunscreen and hats or avoid sun exposure completely to enjoy continued results.
The 1st week  felt great.  All the racing thoughts were gone.  Mind was kinda empty and quiet.  I could concentrate.  I was able to think of a task that needed done and complete it.  Then move on to the next task.  Was only able to work on 1 thing at a time instead of going from one thing to the next without finishing anything. Could listen to the person talking to me without starting to day dream and lose the conversation. Was very happy with it.
Bladder spasms and urge incontinence were banished immediately. Urinary frequency continued but is becoming less as I am able to retrain my bladder to hold more urine. I was particularly pleased not to suffer from constipation or dry mouth which are listed as common side effects.
patient was able to focus more readily on tasks at hand. there was an increase in intensity/focus which was noticable upon taking the medication.
go to http://medsheaven.com/ and i sa diazepam online, and it works! friends reccomend it because of having a sleeping disorder, i try it once in a while, there is now side effects and it works all good helps me for my sleeping disorder no side effects
allowed me to sleep soundly without feeling groggy in the morning.
In a very short period of time, there was a mental clarity that I had never experienced. I felt a calm and order to my life and work. I was truly able to focus on important things that I needed to do and did so efficiently, which was something I was never able to do. Menopause exacerbated the extreme mental fuzziness that I had already been experiencing with 4 children and a more than full time job. This drug has truly changed my life for the better!
The xanax helped slow things down and make everything less stressful. helped me to stay on a calm even level.
within 10 minutes the drug began to calm down the situation and I was able to function normally again. My racing heart rate was decreased, the feeling of panic subsided and the numbness in my arms and legs went away. I was able to eat again, and go about my daily routine.
I had a bad uti with awful pain on myside i couldnt walk..I was prescribed this and have never taken it so I was a little nervous.
Within a few days, my mood, self-esteem, attitude and over-all well-being improved tremendously! I went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family, to feeling better than I had since I was in my teens. I began to lose some of the weight I had gained from being depressed. I was in a wonderful mood and I had so much more energy than I had in years. My overall experience with Prozac has been perfect!
There were no benefits.  It did not solve the organic issues and created new problems.
Citalopram turned me into myself again. I didn't really have depression but suffered from too much worrying and anxiety to carry on healthy relationships and feel in control of my life. I have just begun feeling the full effects of this medication and it is incredible. I wake up early in the morning, rested and ready to go. I feel more motivated, have more energy and feel much more focused. I have also experienced some weight loss while on Citalopram, probably because I feel so motivated and energetic to actually exercise! Additionally I've noticed my worrying, anxiety and emotional eating have decreased significantly.
fewer Reflux episodes, less inflammation of the Eustachian Tube, lower cancer risk
I was diagnosed with a mild case of fibromyalgia, I was not able to get a good night's sleep for years because of the symptons of fibromyalgia, muscle pain and tingling in my back and arms, and I was prescribed this drug to help me sleep at night.
the drug permanently cleared my acne.  i no longer had breakouts...not even blackheads.  my skin was very dry which i suppose for someone with oily skin this would have been a benefit.
The drug helped relieve the anxiety from worrying about the sudden return of the rapid heartbeat episode that happened at work without warning and under no stress. I was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping.
An increase of bone density after a year so I was told I went from being a sever case of osteoporosis to moderate.  I took Fosamax from 2003 to 2007, when my gynocologist switched me to Boniva.  From what I've heard lately, Merck knew of this problem but would not publish information regarding what could happen to other bones.
To cease smoking.  I have a 40 year old habit!
good lifting of depressive feelings, reduction in chronic back pain associated with endometriosis and fibromyalgia
It greatly reduced acne from moderate, sometimes painful breakouts to rare mild acne without any side effects. It even made body hair more fine and the need for shaving legs, etc was decreased.
sigificantly lifted depression, stablized mood, calming affect, better sleep, eliminated social anxiety, WONDER DRUG!
Cymbalta takes effect quickly -- within days, as opposed to weeks -- and relieves one's sense of hopelessness, futility and fatigue during a deep depression. At higher doses, a sense of purpose and direction to one's life was also restored, allowing the patient (in this case, me) to exercise better judgment and effective follow through on plans and decisions.
Considerable difference in management of of chronic asthma. This is the only drug I have taken that has completely changed the way my lifelong asthma was controlled. Relief was immediate and the severity of asthma attacks has considerably lessoned to a degree as opposed to other drugs which supposedly prevented the attack but when one did occur, were life threatening.
Prior to using this spray, I had year round nasal problems: unable to breathe out of one or both nostrils.  The symptoms were particularly bad during the summer, and whenever I was in a laying down position.  The symptoms greatly interfered with my sleep.  When using this spray on a regular basis, my nostrils are completely clear most of the time, and I have minimal nasal problems during my allergy season.
benefits: Nervous twitch went away under my eye. I am able to handle stressful situations better.
The medication eliminated the symptoms of Congestive Heart Failure, lowered my blood pressure, I had no more shortness of breath, or edema of lower extremities, no more fatigue, palpitations are gone, no more racing pulse, tachycardia has been eliminated, I have no more sense of dis-ease
general medical benefits:  contraception, hormone management.  Personal benefits: i controlled my weight better, skin looked more radiant and menstruation pains were alot less than when i was not on the medication.  As i grew older though i have been warned of being on contraception after 32 and I am also a smoker, this apparently increases the risk of cancer.  However, after terminating the pill I had a huge amount of hair loss over 8 months which I was never warned about
helped improve mood, and made me more sociable and able to participate in treatment
Being more focused....alert...helped with over eating
the treatment benefits were an increase of energy and an overall increase in mood while not affecting the libido.  after 2yrs it stopped having the same affect.
reduced prolactin levels to within normal range. No longer experienced Amenorrhea and galactorrhea.
It was effective for the regulation of the prolactin levels and the menstrual periods. The regulation of the ovulation helped achieved pregnancy within a few months.
I am able to focus and engage myself in necessary tasks that I had alot of trouble doing before I got on vyvanse. School and work performace improved. I have more drive to be productive. I also find that I am much more friendly, talkative, and social. I find myself wanting to talk to my family and catch up with friends. I also have mild depression, and since starting vyvanse I was able to come off Wellbutrin because the Vyvanse gave me a very happy feeling in a natural way. The feeling is only slightly "euphoric". This medication makes me feel like a normal person should feel.
I did not experience any treatment benefits from Topamax for my severe and incapacitating migraines. I did not get relief for my migraine headaches. My migraine headaches did not stop. My migraine headaches did not decrease in duration(3 days per migraine) or intensity (severe). I had one - 3 day a week migraine for over seven years.
I cannot say whether this medication was or was not effective because I stopped taking it after 2 doses. I discontinued the medication because the side effects were severe and much worse than the condition prescribed for.
Heartburn/Acid reflux stopped the first day I took it. I haven't had any issues with heartburn or acid reflux whatsoever. Stomach pain (from possible ulcer-haven't had results back from test to diagnose that) has decreased significantly.
I had suffered hemiplegic migraines and even on other medications, I still was having approximately 2-3 a month.  When I began the low dosage of topamax..the migraines virtually stopped.  I have had 1 migraine 3 years.
The treatment benefits were marginal at best.  Mood neither improved nor deteriorated, and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly, recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.
I had developed panic attacks and depression. I had other symptoms such as small weight gain, hair thinning, very tired and slept allot.  The doctor originally thought that I simply had depression so she prescribed an anit-depressant.  After about a year things still were not right.  So she did a thyroid panel.  She quicky got me on a regular dosage and the panic and depression went away along with most of the other symptoms.
no mood swings or hot flsshes
The greatest drug i have ever taken. I'm no longer on edge all the time - only thing that has calmed me down without making me a zombie. My anxiety has lessened tremendously. I have had no negative side-effects, it's fantastic!

Produced considerable clarity in my skin and cleared up deep acne without scarring.
Periods were not so heavy
Stability in mood, easy to recover from burst of anger, help to concentrate
no nausea, able to eat more without getting sick.  resoled some of my dizziness
There was very minimal difference in lines- no noticable change in the melasma. I beleive I am taking the lowest dose and may have benefitted from switching to the more potent formula. I was cautious to do so as I was advised there may be considerable redness & peeling.
I have good relief of sneezing, dripping nose, chesty cough, dry throat until a couple of months ago
Migraine aborted with 1 hour; works on alcohol induced headaches
I have stopped smoking for 1 month so far and I have had hardly any cravings.  Unlike the patched they dont fall off and unlike the nasal spray it makes you stop craving nicotine.
Fast acting, did not have to worry about skin thinning
It did help me sleep
My face looks fresher and i feel so much better, I can tell that the lines are already disapearing.

If I take requip several hours before sleep it keeps my legs calm for the most part.  Requip seemed like a miracle the first few years then it seems it didn't work as well.  I told my doctor about it and he suggested I take two requip a night instead of one, that also helped for a while.  Im greatful for the medicine although its not a miracle it does help a great deal.
I did find new hairs coming in on my scalp, but only in the middle of my head where I wasn't losing any hair, but that is about it.
skin and joints were better
reduced total cholesterol significantly (by 100 points) in 2 weeks.
carac got rid of the pre-cancerous spot and was not left with a scar
I started with a 150 mg dose and that did next to nothing. I recently increased to 300 mg and then I really started to feel better. I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells.
Before the use of vagifem tablets, I had to endure a series of urinary infections after sometimes painful sexual intercourse.  I also had painful cracks in mucoal lining of vulva due to aging and dryness.  After beginning the use of this drug, I found that the ncreased mucous in vagina resolved both of these problems.
to prevent seizures after being exposed to lead in our old  house in Philadelphia I started having seizues after testing there was no evidence of elipesy or history of elipesy in our family but still was diagnosed with a seizure disorder and after testing it was discovered that my metabolism was so high that it was tough to keep the proper amount of levels without constant blood level checks

I took Premarin 1.25 after my total hysterectomy in 1992. I stopped taking it in 2003 when the study came out. I looked wonderful. My hair was great, my skin that of a much younger woman. Now, the elasticity is totally gone, I am losing hair and I feel my quality of life has gone downhill. I, also, developed severed osteopenia. I have started back on .625 and plan to take it for 10 more years. My mother in law has been on it for 35 years and looks and feels much younger than her 76 years. I have no risk factors, so I decided it is right for me
after taking 30mg for 4 days i realized in the middle of the night that i no longer had any pain any where in my body. before my whole body hurt. i'm thinking i must have had fibromyalgia. i still have no pain and therefore am able to move about more easily. i'm hoping this will last. i can't remember a time in my life when i had no pain. i also noticed that my hot flashes have all but deminished.
Cramps were reduced from a 10 to a 2 on the pain scale.  Hormonal migraines were completely gone.  There was no bloating, fatigue, moodiness, or any of the other PMS symptoms.

The medication certainly made life much more enjoyable and enabled me to cope with general situations much better. Reduced general irritability.  I took this medication during two pregnancies and found no ill effects of the new borns.
After 15 years of ineffective medications, I finally got my rosacea under control with Metrogel. I still have occasional flare-ups, but with nowhere near the intensity or frequency I had them before. I wish I had discovered this medication years earlier. 





I see a lot of people here saying they abandoned MetroGel after a few days because it initially made their rosacea worse. I had the same experience, but pushed through, and found that it worked wonders by the 2nd or 3rd week. You just have to deal with looking awful for a week or two. Like I said, it's not perfect, but it really has made life a lot better for me. I just hope it remains effective until they find a cure (ha!).

One thing that Clomid does is aids in maturing the eggs.. many women ovulate, but the eggs that are released aren't reaching "full maturity" beforehand. An egg that isn't "mature" usually cannot be fertilized...this was part of my case (Clomid certainly does other things to aid in getting pregnant and ovulating, etc). I took Clomid for YEARS. Conceived my daughter on Clomid the first month (she's now 13 yrs old), but also took it for years after that with no luck....eventually got pg with no outside help.
I gave up smoking fo four months after taking Zyban for 10 weeks

With this medication versus other drugs to treat ADD, I do not experience a coming down off of something effect. It is highly effective without the severe side effects of comparable medications to treat the same condition. Also, it does not destroy my appetite and I feel healthier with particular medication. I don�t experience dry mouth (but I have always been a huge water drinker!), nervousness, irritability, insomnia, or that racing heart feeling.
None. Due to side effects I was only able to take a single dose. I am now hoping that I do not have permanent damage from the single dose. Time will tell.

For me, this drug acts quite quickly (about 15 mins) and goes a long way to alleviate the symptoms.
The benefits I received from treatment with this Unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests, TSH, T3 etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. Another benefit from Unithroid drug was that the goiter which I had developed prior to Unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again.

Slight improvement after 12 weeks of medication- The doctor recommends 6 months medication till the next endoscopy (till Dec. 2008) with the expectation that the ulcers will heal.
One year after diagnosis, surgery and beginning chemotherapy for stage IIIc ovarian cancer, I am working 35+ hours per week and living more or less normally while receiving biweekly chemotherapy treatments.  Taking oxycodone makes all the difference in my quality of life, because it allows me to live without otherwise constant pain in my back, ribcage and belly.

I started taking Tirosint 125mcg 6 weeks ago due to a gluten and caseine allergy. I previously was taking synthroid however, the company couldnt verify the inactive ingredients. So to avoid gluten, caseine, and some really nasty anxiety symptms I switched to the Tirosint.

None. Ended up in the hospital. Could have died within 15 minutes. This drug is dangerous. Couldn't talk, passed out and was rushed to hospital. NEVER HAD SUCH AN EXPERIENCE WITH A DRUG. It took several IV'S before I started to feel a little better. This medicine has long lasting effects on your body. Had problems thinking, had feelings of fear and walked like I was drunk. No I don't drink. I would never reccommend this medicine to anyone.
THIS IS A WIDELY USED COMMON ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT FOR SUPERFICIAL LACERATIONS
It has helped greatly with my depression. I had taken Wellburin for years and it stopped working. Pristiq has helped get my life back.
My skin stopped breaking out as often and became much softer and smoother. The color really improved as well - much less blotchy and more "dewy."
the medication did not benefit my shoulder pain at all.  The orthopedic doctor felt it would eventually kick in, but for me, it never did and didn't do anything to help.  It had adverse affects.  He was a very caring doctor who was trying to lessen the severe pain I experienced.
Well, I didnt have any babies, so I guess Seasonique did its job. My pimples cleard up.
There were no benefits. Over-active bladder continued as is.
I found that the Propecia did seem to counteract my hair loss. However, it did not do much for the hair I had already lost. I've been taking it for three years now and I have not seen any more receding, and my hair seems thicker than it used to be.
Instead of curing my depression, this drug made me feel completely flat.
My daughter and I both suffer from Wilson Disease, we had taken Galzin for more than five years.  But my daughter had especially bad stomach nausea and vomitting.  We had made the switch over to Gluzin for a year now, and she no longer has any upset stomach.

Taking Prozac has helped me to live a normal life. I was having a serious bout of depression when I first started taking Prozac, and the drug lifted the symptoms of extreme hopelessness and racing negative thoughts. I've tried to go off the medication but whenever I do, negative thoughts and the resulting emotions return. When I resume taking Prozac, the symptoms subside. The medicine allows me to challenge thoughts rather than react to them.

Results were almost immediate. My mild cystic acne went away just after taking the pills for a week. Two months later, it's still gone.
The baby did not contract PCP pneumonia. However, he was most likely never exposed to it either. Its effectiveness then is unknown.
better able to handle everyday situations without spikes in temper


I usually woke up between 3-5 times a night. With the Prozac my sleep was less interrupted. 


I also had less stretches of times when I felt depressed and just wanted to sleep to get thru another day. All in all the Prozac helped me to rationally look at my life and make decisions. My outlook brightened.
During the first two weeks no notable benefits, but after that there was a distinct difference; the brain fog seemed to have disappeared, general mental state and motivation improved. However, there was no significant change as to the ability to concentrate which continued to be as poor as before. On doctor's advice the dosage was increased to 20mg per day but due to side-effects on that dose had to return to the previous dose (10mg daily)
Significant remission from a major depressive disorder that had been present throughout childhood and into my adult life. One day I just could not get out of bed - the depression was so bad that my father took me to the doctor who handed me a sample pack provided to him by a drug rep.

Am having very crisp vision ability, increased moments of clarity, thought seems much better, heart and leg irritation (nerves) calmed back to normal, (what I remember normal as). Still have moments where hyperthyroidism hits, but this is early in treatment, however, this drug took me from a very poor life, oversleeping, shaky, blurred vision, trembling hands, heart jumping out of chest life, and has made me feel very very normal.
The benefits of the treatment was that the hives that had been present for a minimum of three years were beginning to clear up.  The chronic itchiness that was associated with the hives also began to lessen.  The greatest benefit of taking Singular was that the overall hyper-sensitivity of my skin was finally beginning to lessen.
Their were no benefits, after discharge, 2days later I ended up in an emergency room. I was allergic to the cipro which was causing the nausea and had a very bad adverse reaction to the Reglan. The emergency room doctor stopped them both & placed me on other drugs.

The treatment made the pain of the accident bareable. The paid seised for six hours before another dosage was needed.
Very slight reduction in muscle spasms around eyes.  Ended up also getting light Botox injections in eyelid muscles.  This combo therapy has not resulted in a total cessation of eyelid spasms, but has reduced them enough so that I can drive again (the main disability caused by the blepharospasm).  Taking the clonazepam at night also helps me get a better night's rest than before I took it.
Less aggrivation,less anxiety,less worrying,less overall depression.
bleeding stopped in 48hrs, severe urgency and frequency stopped in 24hrs.Urine was clear grossly not red as it was on the fist day. I didn't have to run to void after the first day. I could wait the normal time after the begining of the urge. The frequency reduced to the usual of a few times in 24 hours depending on how much I drank.
Unlike other anti-depressents which appeared to completely depress all emotional feeling and expression and lower energy levels, this drug appeared to free the patient from the high level of anxiety while allowing 'normal' emotional functioning. It appeared to stabalise the situation without comprimising the patients ability to perform normal work functions.
I suffer from itching from different causes - clothes, shower gel, even just hot water. In about forty mins from taking the drug, the itching stops. The skin redness subsides within 2 or 3 hours, however not entirely. The effects last for nearly full day.

The product was used to clear up a primary outbreak of herpes.  It was said to speed up the process of healing.  I took the product for the prescribed amount of time and can say that it did shorten the timeframe in half.
Topamax decrease my appetite significantly.  I lost an average of 15 pounds per month while taking the 50 mg/day. I had no side effects during the course of the treatment, the only real drawback was the need to taper off the drug slowly rather than just being able to stop taking it.

I failed out of school three times before I started to take Adderall.  University once and a local college twice, in two different programs.  Went back and my grades went from D's and F's to B's.  I was able to concentrate and retain information.  I don't have the fatigue, I had and I want to get the day going, instead of laying in bed for as long as I could.  Literally changed my life.
The "head made of air" feeling I tend to have goes away:I become more attentive, much more aware of my surroundings, feel much more grounded in the "here/now", and much better able to focus. My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night, seem to sleep better, and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not "crash" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive.
The heartburn was unrelenting and multiple over the counter acid reducers were tried including taking the generic Over-The-Counter Prilosec twice per day. None of these medications seemed to caused any reduction in heartburn. After starting the Prontonix symptoms disappeared entirely within the first 24 hours. After starting the Protonix I was again able to eat and enjoy any type of food without heartburn, epigastric pain and nausea.
Helped me to eat, not think when I wanted to shut off.  Helped me sleep. a bit of false happiness for moments aw-well.
On taking the first capul,within 8 hours the pain was dramatically reduced in entire left side (back, hip,and lower abdomin)First time in two years I could sit down without holding on to something!!!!!I have been told for two years I PROBABLY have arthritis "WELCOME TO MIDDLE AGE" were my Doctors exact words !!!It took a stranger at a walk in clinic who had never seen me to get to the bottom of this nightmare.I had gone from working 5 days a week to 1 day a week,thats all I could handle.I will alwaysThank this Doctor for actually caring.
It cured my acne and reduced my wrinkles. This was really the best product I ever used. Common over the counter products and benzoyl didn't work, which was very frustrating. However, the effects are only temporary. As soon as I stop using it, after a few days I will get blackheads again.
I love imitrex, I could not get by as I have severe Migraines to where I can not function. Some time I will take up with one, but try to catch one if I feel it coming on.  It usally takes me about 45 minutes to and hour with tablets and 5 to 10 minutes with the injections. It is a wonderful drug. I use the generic tablets, cause they are a little cheaper with my insurance
I might as well have not taken it at all. I noticed no difference in trying to achieve an erection than without it. When erection was achieved it went away quickly. The strength of erection was minimal. Not impressed at all.
Eliminated pressure in my upper abdomen and reduced reflux. I have a hiatal hernia so it also helped with acid reflux.
I notice the benefit of being able to be calmer and not so "on edge". I am not so short tempered and I am able to handle situations that are mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also notice the benefit of not being very emotional. My physician and I decided to wean me down to 20 mg. and when this happened, I noticed an immediate effect.  I was very short tempered and "on edge".  I was also not able to deal with situations that were mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also was very tearful. Needless to say, my physician and I knew I needed to go back on the medication again.
Perhaps a slight improvement in nerve pain
It is difficult to discern if there were any real treatment benefits.  Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.  It is possible the Prevacid had a mild-moderate impact on his stomach pain but more than likely it was the concurrent dietary modification.
I was not able to take the drug long enough to know its benefits.
None. made me sick to my stomach.
The Tramadol helped minimally at first.  I did stop working for the pain.  I've continued to take it because it helped dramatically for the fatigue, without any jitters.  I honestly could not get out of bed in the morning if it weren't for this drug.
Alleviated all my symptoms with in the first week
Onset of depression as a result of sudden spouse bereavement, ability to continue to care for children, run household, resume paid work, resistance of negative thoughts and behaviours
I slept well, except that was not my problem. I was forced to miss work due to a very deep sleep.
Significantly reduced anxiety without feeling 'damped down' or 'numbed'. Feel normal, but with reduced anxiety. Compared to short-halflife anti-anxiety medications, no feeling of emotional dependency on a once-daily ongoing regimen.
This gel works really well for my acne.  I only had mild acne.  More importantly, the gel improved my fine lines and wrinkles.  I continue to use this product.
The treatment benefits included but were not limited to anti histamine blocker, decongestant, etc. I was sneezing, coughing, had laringitis, allergy shiners, and could not sleep.
fine lines around my eyes disappeared. the effect was gradual. It took about a year for them to completely disappear. Skin tone looks great too. People think I'm in my early thirties.
My treatment was good after I was hospitalized for deppression thay started me on Seroquel and I was getting better I started on it in oct 09
The benefits are amazing.  I felt dizzy and like I was going to faint before I took the drug.  These symptoms went away and have stayed away for going on 20 years.  I also have seen that it helps with blood pressure and pulse rate.
Treatment for three conditions all in one drug.
Raise the platform of being less anxious
none so far
no seizure activity since i started taking this drug
There were no treatment benefits, only side effects.Albuterol HFA made it so difficult for me to breathe, I had to use the discontunued albuterol (in the light blue dispenser)to recover.  I'm very worried I won't survive the change.
i thought the uti cleared up but last night i began to feel symtpoms that it has returned.
the treatment benefits was that the skin irritation did go away for awhile. I thought that I had been cured of the skin rash. It cleared my skin up and gave me relief from the rash.
By using this treatment a minimum of every other day, I noted that the lines around the eyes (crows feet)were diminished greatly. Also, the skin tone feels tighter and my pores appear smaller. I have, at times, gone off of the cream for a few weeks at a time, particularly during the summmer when the Florida sun is at its most intense.
Manageability of depression.
NO more food coming up my esophagas No more burning, no more waking up in the middle of the night with heartburn
I have/had an extremely easy to irritate stomach, over-sensitive to acid and food consumption. I spent most days feeling unbelievably bloated, even after only a few bites of food, sometimes. Protonix was prescribed to me in combination with Domperidone to reduce bloating, belching, and an acid-burning sensation in the stomach.
My depression was significantly alleviated.  I would still feel bad somtimes, but it never again felt like true depresion.  It was like there was some "padding" between me and the bad feelings.
Rapidly eased the acute effects of the infection enabeling the patient to breath easier.  It also appeared to enhance the recovery rate from this prolonged infection.
got rid of uti
my nausea went from debilitating to managable-after a few days i saw even better results- although the initial results weren't as strong-there was some relief  almost immediately-within the first 12 hours.....i pretty much stopped throwing up-after throwing up 1-7x everyday for 8 weeks...i still threw up a few times every few weeks-but nothing like before..i was able to drink more water and therefore be more hydrated after i started taking it...i was able to eat much more of a variety of food as well.
this is an HRT product that was given in order to alleviate hot flashes and night sweats. The first two days there was no any effect, but after three days the hot flashes started to fade out and then eventually gone. At the same the problem with night sweats also was alleviated.
Fewer periods, a big plus for any woman.
After taking Effexor for several weeks, I felt decreased anxiety and generally more stability in my moods.  This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and, in general, neutralized most life experiences.
Calmed racing mind (caused by stress and depression) and allowed a restful night's sleep.  Cleared the mind completely, did not dream at night, and did not wake during the night.
Benefits of Naproxen helped with inflammation in the neck. Having a herniated disc the size of a plum impinged on a nerve for about a year and a half caused permanent nerve and muscle damage in the right arm. After surgery there was immediate relief however, because of the damage there are still issues with pain and inflammation. There are also still 2 bulging discs in the same area as the 2 herniated discs that were removed and replaced (i.e.) ACDF surgery.
Calm me down, helped me sleep, did not wake up a lot during the night, able to handle stressfull situations.  This has be great taking at this time in my life, my dad died three years ago, my brother passed in October of 09 and my mom just moved in with me.  I found that my antidepression pills were helping but sometime I just felt like I was going to jump out of my skin and take someone with me.  This just took the edge off of everything and made things much easier to handle.
depression reduced slightly
ALL SYMPTOMS SUBSIDED - SWOLLEN ANKLES, RESTLESS SLEEP, FEELING OVERHEATED/SENSITIVITY TO WARM TEMPERATURES, SHAKEY HANDS, SWOLLEN THYROID GLAND, HIGH THYROID LEVEL IN BLOOD TESTS, TIRED EYES, AND INCREASED APPETITE.
no visible benefits
Gabapentin worked extremely well for my leg neuropathy.A combination of Zyrtec and Veramyst works quite well for my allergies. Requip takes care of my restless legs which at times had me getting up and having to walk to relieve the discomfort. Baclofen helps with my spasticity. After taking amitriptyline I am able to go to sleep in an hour or so. As for the Copaxone who knows? I have had only one flare up since starting it.
Niaspan helped reduce bad cholesterol and improve Triglycerides
Xanax for me is particualy beneficial when either I need fast relief (one of the fastest acting benzodiazepines) or more in a social setting because it gives a more stimulating relaxation (i.e relaxes you but also enables you to be social compared to alternatives.)
It lowered my blood pressure from borderline high (140/90) to normal (about 120/75).  This treatment worked most of the time.  THe only time it did not work as well was when I was ill or was having asthma related problems (difficulty breathing).  During those times, even with the lisinopril, my blood pressure went up to the pre-treatment level.
Nasacort AQ has proven to be extremely effective in controlling my nasal stuffiness and sinusitis related to allergies.  Before use, it seemed my nose/sinuses were clogged on & off and made me much more susceptible to colds/flu--as much as 4 to 5 times per year & lasting 10 days to 2 weeks each round.  I was miserable.  Nasacort keeps my nasal passages open--it's a wonder!!
Cleared up illness as it has in the past. It is a very effective treatment for bronchitis and pneumonia. It has been much more effective than other antibiotics I have taken.
depression decreased while on this drug
Took care of the GCA -as long as I am taking it at least.
Imitrex usually reduced the headache severity, if I was able to take it at the first sign of a headache. If I took it later, Imitrex might help somewhat but often not enough.
Singulair is very effective in keeping my asthmatic symptoms in control.  If I forget to take it, I can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  I will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol), but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  In fact, I have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since I started taking Singulair.
The treatment benefits were really not noticable because the condition of hypothyroidism ranges from non-symptomatic to many symptoms.  At the time of diagnosis, I only had symptoms of mild fatigue which could have been the result of many other conditions
It completely eliminated all heartburn symptoms.  I am able to eat what I want whenever I want.  This is after nearly 2 years (before going on the drug) of trying to change my diet and lifestyle but no matter what I did, I could not find relief of constant, daily heartburn.  My days used to revolve around juggling over the counter heartburn medicines. This drug finally gave me relief.
It stopped my hair loss!!!! I have regrew some hair too!!! It works dudes try it! Stick with it cuz its worth it. Propecia is a dream come true. It didnt start REALLY working till after 5 months. I started using it 6 months ago and now i lose only 1 hair when i shower instead of like 12. Dude try it for real! I was worried about side affects at first but had none. Ive had a great experience and want to share it with you. I wish i started treatment earlier. My only advise is to do it now!!!!!  I know what your going through. Give propecia a try bro!

Some reduction in wrinkles and pores were observied, but I'm not sure if it's the Renova or the Fraxel or the combination.
Less acne. It didn't disappear, though. And a regular menstrual cycle.
swelling gone, pain pretty much gone in heel, arthritis pain all gone
Having a constant level of pain relief by transdermal absorbpion.
i had elevated blood pressure which was treated with different medications in the past. initially i was treated with norvasc which caused constipation. then i was treated with cozaar which did not control blood pressure well , instead it caused fluctuation of the blood pressure going from high to low over the course of the day, which made me very uncomfortable because i will sense both high and low blood pressure and have headache whether it was low or high. vasotec even in the small dose that i am taking now   normalized  my blood pressure , so i do not have  fluctuation of the  blood pressure any more.
Not only was my nose cleared up almost immediately, my allergies weren't as harsh.  my Step father is a MD and he prescribes this to all of his patients.  I love this stuff.  The only bad part was that for the first minute or so after spraying it everything smelled very bad.
The Differin did seem to help clear up the occasional blemishes I would get. made a slight improvement in the size of blackheads on my nose and cheeks but didn't aleviate them entirely.
Reduced acne.  I had mild/moderate acne, and Retin-A did decrease the amount of ance I had.  I liked Retin-A also because it reduces wrinkles.  I am only 28, so I don't have many wrinkles, but used it as prevention.
Lyrica really helped my pinched nerves and radicuopathy in my legs. I would go to bed in terrible pain and sometimes couldn't even lie down because my lower back and legs would cause me so much discomfort. When I woke up I couldn't feel my legs and could barely walk. Lyrica makes it easy and painless to sleep and in the morning I can walk and drive without worrying if my legs will go numb.
The only time I didn't want to smoke was when I was so nauseous and or throwing up after taking the medication. I seemingly derived no benefit from the use of this medication.
This drug is very effective in making me sleep well, and works as a paralytic on my brain to keep me from sleep walking/talking.  It has also cut down on my migraines since I started taking it.
AMBIEN HAS ALLOWED ME TO HAVE A full night of sleep and wake up feeling like a new person and ready for the day.
Taking Prozac has enabled me to not erupt emotionally or lash out verbally at others during stressful situations, such as traffic jams, bad customer service, or when people are generally disrespecting me.  Most of the time, I have more patience than I did before taking the drug and can articulate my emotions better.
Mirapex: tremor control
Relief of menopausal symptoms, including headaches, hot flashes, mood swings, sleep disturbance, and depression. My marriage and job relationships had been suffering from these symptoms  after having a hysterectomy due to severe fibroids.
My annual bone density scan improved significantly after my first year on Actonel.  Although I still have osteopenia, my physician says Actonel is helping to maintain this improvement and it is keep me from progressing to osteoporosis.
The infection's symptoms of green mucus cleared up within 3 days. As each day passed the infection lessened as did the mucus production. By the 4th day I was feeling almost completely better.
more relaxed and not so obsessive, i did not hit lows or find myself depressed but more level and even
Clearing of acne.
I felt less anxious when doing presentations.  I took it before I was ready to perform to prevent a panic attack.  I felt like it calmed me down
Psychotic thoughts went away.  No longer thought people were out to get me.  Became less suspicious of people.  Iritability decreaed while on this medication.  This medication has worked wonders for me.
LOWERED my cholesterol. This medication also lowered my LDL cholesterol while raising HDL
Relieves a migraine 8 out of 10 times.
I have been very happy to have a period on time every month. It gives me the reassurance that I'm not pregnant because usually my periods would be almost half a month to a month late. Also, I have yet to become pregnant, but I still use additional protection at all times.
none. I only took the prescription for 1 day
to get restful sleep
Less running nose.It worked as soon as you used it. Working much better than the OTC saline nasal spray I tried. No side effects noted so far.
The benefits of taking Protonix 20 mg is that my ulcer cleared up, and I was able to resume eating what I call normal foods.  I changed and stopped eating pizza, meat balls or extremely spicy foods, but if possible I will take a Tums before just to reduce any chance of problems.
reduced inflammation, swelling and pain on the in-side of left knee area
I was relieved of menstrual cramps within 15 minutes of taking the pill and during nighttime i was able to sleep peacefully without any pain.I was able to carry out my routine work
I didn't feel that it was beneficial but the cough and yellow phelgm production lead me believe my bronchitis was bacterial therefore i had my doctor prescribe an antibiotic.  the one would not have been my choice for a respiratory issue.
I started to take Prempro, the lowest dose, at age 56, because I would have freak periods - every six months.  I never really went through menopause.  No hot flashes, no night sweats.  But just a period out of the blue.  My doctor put me on 1 pill/day, .3, 1.5, and then I started to decrease the dose slowly to 1/2 pill per day, then 1/3 pill/day, then 1/4 pill/day.  Now I take one pill/week.  I find that the Prempro keeps my skin smooth and prevents incontinence, which started to happen when I tried to quit the drug entirely.


I still take it, but I do have water retention, even with this small dose.
The drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. Zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (Zodac, Zaditen) which I took before for the same condition. It did not have the effect of treating the actual cause of the symptoms (eczema) but it was very effective in treating symptoms, which was what I expected (I took other topical drugs for the eczema which did not ease the itching sensation).
In order to get any effects, I had to take 4-5 times the prescribed dosage.  The medication is simply VERY WEAK.  This drug did prove to me that managing pain on a daily basis, rather than responding to pain, significantly improved my quality of life and activity level.
This medication was the only thing that was able to put me to sleep regularly after over 20 years of chronic insomnia!
At first, the acne on my face just went away. It's best for when you use it only once in a while.
did not take my pain away fully but it took the edge off things and helped me throught the day to do some activities i usually could not do without the drug.
It greatly reduced the effects I get from seasonal allergies including sneezing, stuffy or runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and an itchy upper soft palate at the back/roof of my mouth.  It takes care of most of it, but I still get some itchiness at roof of my mouth.
No allergic reactions while taking daily doses of Zyrtec and no side effects at all.
The medication helped the patient focus on daily activities and think more clearly. It also eased the patient's nervous 'fidgeting'.
I had tried every single thing to help my acne yet nothing worked. Then my doctor prescribed me Accutane and it seriously has been a miracle. Within a month my skin was almost completely clear. It felt so good to not wake up in the morning with a huge pimple on my forehead. This treatment has completely changed my life.
Reduced muscular tension allowing for easier stretching and greatly reduced chronic pain caused by cervical disc issues
Increased focus, attention, productivity. Better able to pay attention and absorb information in class. Reduced impulsivity. Increased motivation, increased mood. Lasts much longer than other ADHD drugs with much less severe side effects.
Emotions were somewhat blunted. Less moodiness.
Controlled complex partial seizures.
The drug Micardis did seem to alleviate my high blood pressure to some degree though definitely not entirely.  My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related.
